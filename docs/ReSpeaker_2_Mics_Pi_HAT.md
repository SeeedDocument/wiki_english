Raspberry Pi zero Connection

![connection picture2](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/MIC_HATv1.0_for_raspberrypi/raw/master/img/pi_zero.jpg)

**2. Setup the driver on Raspberry Pi**

While the upstream wm8960 codec is not currently supported by current Pi kernel builds, upstream wm8960 has some bugs, we had fixed it. We must build it manually.

Make sure that you are running [the lastest Raspbian Operating System(debian 9)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) on your Pi. *(updated at 2018.11.13)*

- Step 1. Get the seeed voice card source code, install and reboot.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/respeaker/seeed-voicecard.git
cd seeed-voicecard
sudo ./install.sh
reboot
```

- Step 2. Check that the sound card name matches the source code seeed-voicecard by command aplay -l and arecord -l.

```
pi@raspberrypi:~/seeed-voicecard $ aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****

  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
pi@raspberrypi:~/seeed-voicecard $
```

- Step 3. Test, you will hear what you say to the microphones(don't forget to plug in an earphone or a speaker):

```
arecord -f cd -Dhw:1 | aplay -Dhw:1
```

**3. Configure sound settings and adjust the volume with alsamixer**

**alsamixer** is a graphical mixer program for the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) that is used to configure sound settings and adjust the volume.

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ alsamixer
```

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/MIC_HATv1.0_for_raspberrypi/blob/master/img/alsamixer.png?raw=true)

The Left and right arrow keys are used to select the channel or device and the Up and Down Arrows control the volume for the currently selected device. Quit the program with ALT+Q, or by hitting the Esc key. [More information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsamixer)

!!!Warning
    Please use the F6 to select seeed-2mic-voicecard device first.

**4. Use the on-board APA102 LEDs**

Each on-board APA102 LED has an additional driver chip. The driver chip takes care of receiving the desired color via its input lines, and then holding this color until a new command is received.

```
sudo pip install spidev
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/respeaker/mic_hat.git
cd mic_hat
python pixels.py
```

</video>


**5. How to use User Button**

There is an on-board User Button, which is connected to GPIO17. Now we will try to detect it with python and RPi.GPIO.

```
sudo pip install rpi.gpio    // install RPi.GPIO library
nano button.py               // copy the following code in button.py
```

```
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

BUTTON = 17

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(BUTTON, GPIO.IN)

while True:
    state = GPIO.input(BUTTON)
    if state:
        print("off")
    else:
        print("on")
    time.sleep(1)
```

Save the code as button.py, then run it. It should display "on" when you press the button:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ python button.py
off
off
on
on
off
```



## Google Assistant SDK

To get started with Google Assistant([what is  Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/)), the first is that you should integrate the Google Assistant Library into your raspberry pi system. Here is the link to [Google official guidance](https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/prototype/getting-started-pi-python/run-sample).

And the following guide will also show you how to get started with Google Assistant.

**1. Configure a Developer Project and get JSON file**

Follow step 1. 2. 3. 4. in the  [guide](https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/prototype/getting-started-pi-python/config-dev-project-and-account#config-dev-project) to configure a project on Google Cloud Platform and create an OAuth Client ID JSON file. Don't forget to copy the JSON file to your Raspberry Pi.

**2. Use a Python virtual environment to isolate the SDK and its dependencies from the system Python packages.**

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-venv # Use python3.4-venv if the package cannot be found.
python3 -m venv env
env/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
source env/bin/activate
```

**3. Install google-assistant-library**

The Google Assistant SDK package contains all the code required to get the Google Assistant running on the device, including the library and sample code. Use pip to install the latest version of the Python package in the virtual environment:
```
(env) $ python -m pip install --upgrade google-assistant-library
```

**4. Authorize the Google Assistant SDK**

Authorize the Google Assistant SDK sample to make Google Assistant queries for the given Google Account. Reference the JSON file you copied over to the device in Step 1.

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ google-oauthlib-tool --client-secrets /home/pi/client_secret_client-id.json --scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/assistant-sdk-prototype --save --headless
```

* `/home/pi/client_secret_client-id.json` should be the path of your JSON file, your should modify the commmand above
* After running the command, it should display as shown below. Copy the URL and paste it into a browser (this can be done on your development machine, or any other machine). After you approve, a code will appear in your browser, such as "4/XXXX". Copy this and paste this code into the terminal.

```
Please go to this URL: https://...
Enter the authorization code:
```

* It should then display: OAuth credentials initialized.
* If instead it displays: InvalidGrantError then an invalid code was entered. Try again, taking care to copy and paste the entire code.

**5. Start the Google Assistant demo**

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ alsamixer    // To adjust the volume
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ source env/bin/activate
(env) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ env/bin/google-assistant-demo
```

**6. Play with Google Assistant**

Say *Ok Google* or *Hey Google*, followed by your query. The Assistant should respond. If the Assistant does not respond, follow the [troubleshooting instructions](https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/prototype/getting-started-pi-python/troubleshooting#hotword).

![run demo](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/MIC_HATv1.0_for_raspberrypi/blob/master/img/okgoogle.jpg?raw=true)

**7. Troubleshooting**

See the [Troubleshooting](https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/prototype/getting-started-pi-python/troubleshooting) page if you run into issues.

**8. Raspbian image**

As Raspbian Operating System is updated to Debian 9, we won't provide our Raspbian image anymore. Click [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) to get the lastest Raspbian Operating System.

- [How to install the image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/)


## STT(Speech to Text) SDK

This part will introduce Baidu STT(Speech to Text) functions together with GPIO control. Here is the GPIOs configuration. If you do not have a fan, You can connect 2 LEDs on GPIO12/GPIO13 to demonstrate.

| GPIO   | Turn On | Faster | Slower | Turn Off |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| GPIO12 | 1       | 0      | 1      | 0        |
| GPIO13 | 0       | 1      | 0      | 0        |


- **Step 1. Install dependiencies**

```
sudo apt install mpg123
pip install baidu-aip monotonic pyaudio
```

- **Step 2. Get Baidu key from [Here](https://console.bce.baidu.com/ai/?fromai=1#/ai/speech/overview/index).**


- **Step 3. Download the [Smart_Fan.py](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/MIC_HATv1.0_for_raspberrypi/raw/master/src/baidu_STT/Smart_fan.py)**

```
cd ~
wget https://github.com/SeeedDocument/MIC_HATv1.0_for_raspberrypi/raw/master/src/baidu_STT.zip
unzip baidu_STT.zip
cd baidu_STT
python Smart_Fan.py
```

!!!Warning
    Please add baidu key @ line 36,37,38 before running python Smart_Fan.py. You also can generate your owner voice by running the synthesis_wav.py. Please do add baidu keys at line 6,7,8 and modify string to what you want to generate.

- **Step 4. Let's say '开风扇'.**

- **Step 5. You will see the fan moving.**

- **Step 6. Let's try '快一点', '慢一点' and '关风扇'.**


## Extract Voice

We use [PyAudio python library](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/) to extract voice.

- Step 1, We need to run the following script to get the device index number of 2 Mic pi hat:

```Python
sudo pip install pyaudio
cd ~
nano get_index.py
```

- Step 2, copy below code and paste on get_index.py.

```Python
import pyaudio

p = pyaudio.PyAudio()
info = p.get_host_api_info_by_index(0)
numdevices = info.get('deviceCount')

for i in range(0, numdevices):
        if (p.get_device_info_by_host_api_device_index(0, i).get('maxInputChannels')) > 0:
            print "Input Device id ", i, " - ", p.get_device_info_by_host_api_device_index(0, i).get('name')
```

- Step 3, press Ctrl + X to exit and press Y to save.

- Step 4, run 'sudo python get_index.py' and we will see the device ID as below.

```
Input Device id  2  -  seeed-2mic-voicecard: - (hw:1,0)
```

- Step 5, change `RESPEAKER_INDEX = 2` to index number. Run python script record.py to record a speech.

```Python
import pyaudio
import wave

RESPEAKER_RATE = 16000
RESPEAKER_CHANNELS = 2 
RESPEAKER_WIDTH = 2
# run getDeviceInfo.py to get index
RESPEAKER_INDEX = 2  # refer to input device id
CHUNK = 1024
RECORD_SECONDS = 5
WAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME = "output.wav"

p = pyaudio.PyAudio()

stream = p.open(
            rate=RESPEAKER_RATE,
            format=p.get_format_from_width(RESPEAKER_WIDTH),
            channels=RESPEAKER_CHANNELS,
            input=True,
            input_device_index=RESPEAKER_INDEX,)

print("* recording")

frames = []

for i in range(0, int(RESPEAKER_RATE / CHUNK * RECORD_SECONDS)):
    data = stream.read(CHUNK)
    frames.append(data)

print("* done recording")

stream.stop_stream()
stream.close()
p.terminate()

wf = wave.open(WAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME, 'wb')
wf.setnchannels(RESPEAKER_CHANNELS)
wf.setsampwidth(p.get_sample_size(p.get_format_from_width(RESPEAKER_WIDTH)))
wf.setframerate(RESPEAKER_RATE)
wf.writeframes(b''.join(frames))
wf.close()
```

- Step 6. If you want to extract channel 0 data from 2 channels, please follow below code. For other channel X, please change [0::2] to [X::2].

```
import pyaudio
import wave
import numpy as np

RESPEAKER_RATE = 16000
RESPEAKER_CHANNELS = 2
RESPEAKER_WIDTH = 2
# run getDeviceInfo.py to get index
RESPEAKER_INDEX = 2  # refer to input device id
CHUNK = 1024
RECORD_SECONDS = 3
WAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME = "output.wav"

p = pyaudio.PyAudio()

stream = p.open(
            rate=RESPEAKER_RATE,
            format=p.get_format_from_width(RESPEAKER_WIDTH),
            channels=RESPEAKER_CHANNELS,
            input=True,
            input_device_index=RESPEAKER_INDEX,)

print("* recording")

frames = [] 

for i in range(0, int(RESPEAKER_RATE / CHUNK * RECORD_SECONDS)):
    data = stream.read(CHUNK)
    # extract channel 0 data from 2 channels, if you want to extract channel 1, please change to [1::2]
    a = np.fromstring(data,dtype=np.int16)[0::2]
    frames.append(a.tostring())

print("* done recording")

stream.stop_stream()
stream.close()
p.terminate()

wf = wave.open(WAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME, 'wb')
wf.setnchannels(1)
wf.setsampwidth(p.get_sample_size(p.get_format_from_width(RESPEAKER_WIDTH)))
wf.setframerate(RESPEAKER_RATE)
wf.writeframes(b''.join(frames))
wf.close()
```
