This is a unique ringâ€“ it has a florid body with 24 controllable LEDs. Maybe it will drive the inspiration out of you to make a glowing magic ring! There is a 1*1 square hollow-out in the middle of this module, where you can place a Grove Encoder in and make it a rotary visual encoder!

##   Getting Started

**Materials required**


| Seeeduino V4.2 | Base Shield |Grove - Circular LED|
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|

>In addition, you can consider our new [Seeeduino Lotus M0+](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-Lotus-Cortex-M0-p-2896.html), which is equivalent to the combination of Seeeduino V4.2 and Baseshield.


!!!note
    **1** Please plug the USB cable gently, otherwise you may damage the port. Please use the USB cable with 4 wires inside, the 2 wires cable can't transfer data. If you are not sure about the wire you have, you can click [here](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Micro-USB-Cable-48cm-p-1475.html) to buy 
    
    **2** Each Grove module comes with a Grove cable when you buy. In case you lose the Grove cable, you can click [here](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Universal-4-Pin-Buckled-20cm-Cable-%285-PCs-pack%29-p-936.html) to buy.


### Hardware Connection


- **Step 1.** Connect the Grove - Circular LED with the **D6** port of the Base Shield.

- **Step 2.** Plug Grove - Base Shield into Seeeduino.

- **Step 3.** Connect Seeeduino to PC via a USB cable.




!!!Note
	If we don't have Grove Base Shield, We also can directly connect Grove - Circular LED to Seeeduino as below.

| Seeeduino       | Grove - Circular LED |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| 5V            | Red                     |
| GND           | Black                   |
| D7           | White                   |
| D6           | Yellow                  |


### Software

!!!Attention
        If this is the first time you work with Arduino, we strongly recommend you to see [Getting Started with Arduino](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Getting_Started_with_Arduino/) before the start.

- **Step 1.** Download the  [Grove - LED Bar Library](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_LED_Bar) from Github.
- **Step 2.** Refer [How to install library](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/How_to_install_Arduino_Library) to install library for Arduino.
- **Step 3.** Open **Arduino IDE -> File -> Examples -> Grove_LED_Bar -> BasicControl**
- **Step 4.** Uncomment the **define MY9221_LED_NUM 24** and comment **#define MY9221_LED_NUM 10** as below. 

```
//#define MY9221_LED_NUM 10
#define MY9221_LED_NUM 24
```

- **Step 5.** Upload the example to Arduino. If you do not know how to upload the code, please check [how to upload code](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Upload_Code/).
- **Step 6.** You can see the led is running from .C, 23 and AB repeatly.


### Play with Codecraft

#### Hardware

**Step 1.** Connect a Grove - Circular LED to port D5 of a Base Shield.

**Step 2.** Plug the Base Shield to your Seeeduino/Arduino.

**Step 3.** Link Seeeduino/Arduino to your PC via an USB cable.

#### Software

**Step 1.** Open [Codecraft](https://ide.chmakered.com/), add Arduino support, and drag a main procedure to working area.

!!!Note
    If this is your first time using Codecraft, see also [Guide for Codecraft using Arduino](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Guide_for_Codecraft_using_Arduino/).

**Step 2.** Drag blocks as picture below or open the cdc file which can be downloaded at the end of this page.

![cc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-Circular_LED/master/img/cc_Circular_LED.png)

Upload the program to your Arduino/Seeeduino.

!!!Success
    When the code finishes uploaded, you will see the LED run in the circular.
