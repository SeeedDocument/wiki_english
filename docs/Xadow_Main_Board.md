The Xadow Main board module is based on the controller **ATmega32U4**. It features high performance and low power consumption, which makes your project small and portable, especially suitable for wearable projects.

The on-board controller **ATmega32U4** has 32K Flash and 2.5K SRAM and 1K EEPROM, it can be also used as a USB slave module, same as the [Seeeduino Lite](https://www.seeedstudio.com/seeeduino-lite-p-1487.html?cPath=6_7), that you can make much more projects with this. This Board can be powered either from the on-board USB connection or a Lithium battery. Also, there is charge circuit on this module that you can charge for the Lithium battery through the USB port.

The first time you use this Xadow main board, please install the related driver and make little modification as Here.

## Board Revisions and Changes
---

**Revision 1.3**
1. This version replaces the J2 and J3 FPC connector to a Flip type. It makes users more easier to connect or disconnect peripherals.
2. Optimize the charge circuit with path control function.
3. Separated the power supply for MCU and peripherals. It makes the MCU working more stable.

## Get Start with Xadow Main Board
---
Similar to the Arduino, the Xadow Main Board uses only a single microcontroller (the Atmel ATmega32U4) to both run your sketches and communicate over USB with the computer. This means that you only need a USB cable to program the Xadow. The specific steps are as follows:
- To make your Arduino IDE support Xadow, there're a few steps you need to follow, please refer to [here]()
- Download the driver files from [https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Signed_USB_Serial_Driver](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Signed_USB_Serial_Driver)
- Connect the Micro-USB cable to the Xadow Main Board.
- Connect the other side of the Micro-USB connector to the computer's USB port.
- Then install the Xadow Driver. You can refer to [Download Arduino and install Arduino driver](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Guide_to_use_demos_downloaded_from_Seeed-s_Github/) to learn how to install the Xadow driver.

 Now, you can program and use the Xadow as you use other Arduino boards.
