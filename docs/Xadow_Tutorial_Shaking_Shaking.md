Connect them with FFC Cables, then you need to do some preparations that refer to the first Demo's steps. Differ from the demo1, you need to download [the library:Smile](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Xadow_Tutorial_Shaking_Shaking/raw/master/https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Xadow_Tutorial_Shaking_Shaking/raw/master/res/SMILE.zip) and directly open SMILE INO file.

This demo functions: In normal circumstances, the OLED displays the current barometric pressure value. When you shake the Xadow Accelerometer, there will appear a smile face on the screen.

## Note

Before uploading the codeï¼šsmile to Xadow main board, please make sure there are the library:OLED_Display12864 and [DigitalAccelerometer_ADX345](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Xadow_Tutorial_Shaking_Shaking/raw/master/res/DigitalAccelerometer_ADXL345.zip) in the Arduino Library. If not, please download them and put them on the libraries file of Arduino IDE by the path: ..\arduino-1.0.1\libraries after unzipping. Do not forget to select Seeed Xadow from the Tools | Board menu of the Arduino environment._
