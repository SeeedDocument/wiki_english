*UartSBee v5'* is FTDI cable compatible **USB to Serial** adapter equipped with BEE socket(20pin 2.0mm). The integrated **FT232RL** can be used for programming or communicating with MCUs. On the other hand, you might connect your PC to various wireless applications via a **Bee** compatible module. UartSBee provides breakouts for the bit-bang mode pins of **FT232RL** as well.This Bit-bang mode pins (8 I/O pins) can be used as a replacement for applications involving PC parallel port which is scares now a day.
