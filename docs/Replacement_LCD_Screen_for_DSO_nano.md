First you need to remove the top panel by using a sharp knife. The top panel is attached with the body by glue, be sure to do this slowly, or you will damage the acrylic panel .

Here you can see 6 screws(marked with white circle) after the top panel is removed. Remove them with a 1.4mm screwdriver, then go to the next step.

Remove the rest 2 screws, now you should be able to take the sub-board apart from the motherboard.

Sub-Board detailed pictures. 6 metal dome buttons were soldered on the top side, and 1×3.5MM TSR connector, 1X Mini usb connector on bottom.  There’s also a board to board connector to attach the 2 separated PCB.

1.  controller: STM32

2.  stabilized voltage supply : 3.3V voltage output

3.  stabilized voltage supply : 3.0V voltage output

4.  stabilized voltage supply : use a P3232 RS-232 transceivers to output +5V and -5V voltage

5.  general purpose dual J-FET operation amplifier : to separate and scale the input signal

6.  8-Channel Analog Multiplexer : change the match channel for different V/div
