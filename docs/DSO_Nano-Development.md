Some resources for developing (on) the [DSO Nano](/DSO_Nano "DSO Nano").

##   Firmware development 

*   Get the source and build it

See [Building the source with gcc](/DSO_Nano-gcc "DSO Nano/gcc"). To build with IAR, see the Links section below.

*   Contribute patches

Please share your modifications at the DSO Nano forum. The best is to post a "diff" from the git repository. E.g. "git diff &gt; mypatch.diff and post the mypatch.diff instead of uploading the whole code tree. Even better is to learn [git](http://git-scm.com/) and make real patch series. Or publish your own git tree somewhere (gitourious.org, github.com etc).

##   Debugging

*   Debug arm code running on the [qemu emulator using gdb](/DSO_Nano-Qemu_gdb "DSO Nano/Qemu gdb")

*   Debug arm code running on a board with JTAG using [OpenOCD and gdb](/DSO_Nano-OpenOCD_gdb "DSO Nano/OpenOCD gdb")
