!!!Attention
        All Satellite Kits require a Base Kit or Raspberry Pi 3 B+ in order to operate as intended


The Voice Interaction Satellite Kit can extend the reach of your base station to each room in your house and enable you to interact with the hardware based on where you issue your commands! You can arrange multiple Satellite Kits throughout your home to add new functionality to the Base Kit or any other smart speaker, extending your voice control across several rooms.


The Voice Interaction Satellite Kit is powered by a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeedstudio-Raspberry-Pi-Zero-W-Barebones-Kit-p-2966.html) and the [ReSpeaker 2-Mics Pi HAT](https://www.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker-2-Mics-Pi-HAT-p-2874.html). Along with the kit comes a speaker, a [Grove - Temperature & Humidity Sensor (SHT31) sensor](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Temperature-Humidity-Sensor-SHT3-p-2655.html), a [Grove - Relay](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Relay-p-769.html), and a pegboard to hang it on a wall or create a nifty stand.


Check out the video below and get started assembling the Snips Voice Interaction Kits to build your next voice interaction project.

## Quick Starter Guide

This guide shows the basic steps to build the out-of-the-box application. For more in-depth development technical documentation, please visit [Snips AI quick start](https://docs.snips.ai/the-maker-kit/dev-kit)


### Assembly Steps:

The following picture is the overview of the assembly parts.

---
Here the assembly parts are mounted on the base panel.

---

Then, all the electronic parts are mounted on the board.

---

After that mount the Acrylic Protective cover on top of the Grove -Relay.

---

These 2 parts are used to make the Kit into a table stand.

---

This is how it looks when the above 2 parts are connected to the base panel.

Finally, you are ready to play with Snips.

The kit provides two ways of placement. It can either be placed on a horizontal surface as a stand or can be hung on a wall using wires or thread.
Please be careful with the Relay when the kit is powered on since the working voltage will be high.


###　Start Playing!

- a. Power the kit by the default power adapter in the kit or use a 5V-2A DC adapter with a Micro USB connector.

- b. The next step is installing the Snips assistant into the Raspberry Pi. To save your setup time, the MicroSD card in the kit has been flashed with the full functional system image, which means the Snips assistant is ready for your trigger words. We strongly suggest you to study the step by step installation guide by visiting : https://docs.snips.ai/getting-started/quick-start-raspberry-pi and learn the sam tool in command line.

- c. Trigger the assistant by saying “Hey-snips”, and follow the command:


Command	| Action
---|---
What’s the temperature?	| Responds with the current temperature
What’s the humidity? |	Responds with the current humidity
Turn the relay on.	| The relay closes and the red LED turns on.
Turn the relay off.	| The relay opens and the red LED turns off.
