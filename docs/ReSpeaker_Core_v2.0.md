</div>


**Image Installation**

Similar to the Raspberry Pi, you need to install the ReSpeaker Core v2.0 image from an SD card to get up and running. We offer two ways to boot the Respeaker core v2.0. You can either boot from the SD card or boot from the eMMC.

**A. Boot from the SD card**

- **Step 1.** Click the [Fangcloud](https://v2.fangcloud.com/share/7395fd138a1cab496fd4792fe5?lang=en) / [mirror-azure](http://respeaker.seeed.io/images/) to download our latest image zip files: ```respeaker-debian-9-lxqt-sd-********-4gb.img.xz``` or ```respeaker-debian-9-iot-sd-********-4gb.img.xz```.


|Section|Description|
|---|----|
|**iot** / **lxqt**|The **lxqt** version comes with a desktop GUI while the **iot** version does not. If you are new to ReSpeaker Core v2.0, **lxqt** version is recommended.|
|**flasher** / **sd**|The **flasher** version is used to flash the onboard eMMC, after flashing you can remove the SD card. The **sd** version will require the SD card to stay inserted all the time.|

  For development, we recommend the **lxqt + sd** version. So please download the **respeaker-debian-9-lxqt-sd-[date]-4gb.img.xz** file.

  <div class="admonition warning">
  <p class="admonition-title">Caution</p>
  This wiki is based on the **respeaker-debian-9-lxqt-sd-20180610-4gb.img.xz** image version.
  </div>

- **Step 2.** Plug the SD card into your PC or MAC with an SD card reader. You need an SD card with a capacity of more than 4G.


- **Step 3.** <font face="">Click to download <a href="https://etcher.io/">Etcher</a> here, and burn the ```*.img.xz``` file directly to your SD card with Etcher. Or unzip the ```*.img.xz``` file to a ```*.img``` file, then burn it to SD card with other image writing tools.
<br>
<br>Click the Plus icon to add the image you just download, the software will automatically select the SD card you plug.Then click Flash! to start burning. It will take about 10 minutes to finish. </font>

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Respeaker_V2/raw/master/img/v2-flash-sd.png)


- **Step 4.** After writing the image to the SD card, insert the SD card in your ReSpeaker Core v2.0. Power the board using the PWR_IN micro usb port and DO NOT remove the SD card after powering on. ReSpeaker Core v2.0 will boot from the SD card, and you can see USER1 and USER2 LEDs light up. USER1 is typically configured at boot to blink in a heartbeat pattern and USER2 is typically configured at boot to light during SD card accesses. Now, you should go to the next part: Serial Console.


**B. Boot from the eMMC**

There is no firmware in the EMMC when leaving the factory, you can flash the ReSpeaker image files to the ReSpeaker's eMMC (onboard flash memory) by using your PC or Mac. Then the ReSpeaker will boot from it's eMMC (onboard flash memory) and not from the SD card.

- **Step 1.** Download our latest image zip file ```respeaker-debian-9-iot-flasher-********-4gb.img.xz``` or ```respeaker-debian-9-lxqt-flasher-********-4gb.img.xz``` at Fangcloud. The lxqt version comes with Debian desktop and the iot version does not. And the flasher version is for flashing eMMC, and the sd version is for booting from SD card.

- **Step 2.** Burn the ```*.img.xz``` file directly to SD card with Etcher, or unzip the ```*.img.xz``` file to a ```*.img``` file, then burn it to SD card with other image writing tools.

- **Step 3.** After burning SD card, insert the SD card in the ReSpeaker Core v2.0. Power the board using the PWR_IN micro usb port and do not remove the SD card while it's flashing.

During the flashing process, you'll see the USER1 and USER2 LEDs blink alternately. It will take about 10 minutes to complete. When the LEDs turn off, you can power off the board, pull out the SD card and power again. If the LEDs light up, that means the image was flashed to the eMMC correctly.

You can also check the image version with this command: cat /etc/issue.net.


**Serial Console**

Now your ReSpeaker Core v2.0 can boot, you might want to get access to the Linux system via a console, to setup the WiFi, etc. You have two ways to get the console:

- A. The OTG USB port - This requires a running Linux system on the board

- B. The UART port - This is the hard way to access the console, it can be used for debugging low level issues


**A. Connection via OTG**

- **Step 1.** Find a micro USB cable, and please make sure it's a data cable (not just a power cable), plug the micro USB end to the ReSpeaker's **OTG** micro USB port (There're two micro USB ports on the ReSpeaker board, which are labeled with different silk-screen, one is **PWR_IN** and another is **OTG**), then plug another end of this cable into your computer.

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Respeaker_V2/raw/master/img/lianjiediannan.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Check at your computer if the serial port has risen:

    - Windows: check the device manager, there should be new serial deviced named ```COMx``` which x is an increasing number. If you use windows XP/7/8, maybe you need install [windows CDC drivers](https://github.com/respeaker/get_started_with_respeaker/blob/master/files/ReSpeaker_Gadget_CDC_driver.7z).
    - Linux: `ls /dev/ttyACM*`, you should get ```/dev/ttyACMx``` where x will vary depending on which USB port you used.
    - Mac: `ls /dev/cu.usb*`, you should get ```/dev/cu.usbmodem14xx``` where xx will vary depending on which USB port you used.


- **Step 3.** Use your favorite serial debugging tool to connect the serial port, the serial has: 115200 baud rate, 8Bits, Parity None, Stop Bits 1, Flow Control None. For examples:

    - Windows: use [PUTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), select ```Serial``` protocol, fill in the correct COM port of ReSpeaker Core v2.0, ```115200``` baud, 8Bits, Parity None, Stop Bits 1, Flow Control None.
    - Linux: Depend on your USB To TTL Adapter, it could be ```screen /dev/ttyACM0(,1, and so on)``` 115200 or ```screen /dev/ttyUSB0(,1, and so on) 115200```
    - Mac: Depend on your USB To TTL Adapter, it could be ```screen /dev/cu.usbserial1412(,1422, and so on) 115200``` or ```screen /dev/cu.usbmodem1412(,1422, and so on) 115200```


- **Step 4.** The default user name is ```respeaker```, and password is ```respeaker``` too.

**B. Connection via The UART port**

In this section we will guide you how to establish a connection from your computer to your ReSpeaker using your USB to TTL adapter which will be connected to the ReSpeaker's Uart port (Uart port located just to the left of the ReSpeaker speaker plug).

- **Step 1.** Connect Uart port and your PC/Mac with an USB To TTL Adapter. Note that the voltage of RX/TX are 3.3V. If you don't have an USB To TTL Adapter, you can click [here](https://www.seeedstudio.com/USB-To-Uart-5V%26amp%3B3V3-p-1832.html) to get one.

- **Step 2.** Use the following Serial debugging tools with 115200 baud:
    - Windows: use [PUTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), select ```Serial``` protocol, fill in the correct COM port of ReSpeaker Core v2.0, 115200 baud, 8Bits, Parity None, Stop Bits 1, Flow Control None.
    - Linux: Depend on your USB To TTL Adapter, it could be ```screen /dev/ttyACM0(,1, and so on) 115200``` or ```screen /dev/ttyUSB0(,1, and so on) 115200```.
    - Mac: Depend on your USB To TTL Adapter, it could be ```screen /dev/cu.usbserial1412(,1422, and so on) 115200``` or ```screen /dev/cu.usbmodem1412(,1422, and so on) 115200```.

- **Step 3.** The login user name is respeaker, and password is respeaker too.

- **Step 4.** If you do not have a USB to TTL Adapter, you may also use an Arduino. If using an Arduino, connect one end of a jumper wire to the RESET pin on the Arduino and the other end to the GND pin on the Arduino. This will bypass your Arduino's ATMEGA MCU and turn your Arduino into a USB to TTL adapter, see video tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqSLwK1DP8Q). Now connect the GND pin on the Arduino to the GND pin on the Uart port of the Respeaker. Connect the Rx pin on the Arduino to the Rx pin on the Uart port of the Respeaker. Connect the Tx pin on the Arduino to the Tx pin on the Uart port of the Respeaker. And lastly, connect the Arduino to your PC/Mac via the Arduino's USB cable. Now check that your Mac or Linux PC finds your Arduino by typing this command:

```
ls /dev/cu.usb* (Mac)
ls /dev/ttyACM* (Linux)
```
You should get back something like:

```
/dev/cu.usbmodem14XX where XX will vary depending on which USB port you used (on Mac)
/dev/ttyACMX where X will vary depending on which USB port you used  (on Linux)
```
Now follow step 2 above to connect to your Respeaker over this serial connection. And note this is a one time procedure as you'll next setup your Respeaker for Wi-Fi connectivity and then connect via ssh or VNC going forward.



**Network Setting Up**

**A. Wi-Fi Setting Up**

Configure your ReSpeaker's network with the Network Manager tool, nmtui. nmtui will already be installed on the ReSpeaker image.

```
sudo nmtui              # respeaker user needs sudo
```
Then you will see a config page like this, select ```Activate a connection``` and press ```Enter``` key.

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Respeaker_V2/raw/master/img/nmtui1-1.png)

Select your Wi-Fi for ReSpeaker v2.0, press ```Enter``` key and type your Wi-Fi password and press ```Enter``` key again. When you see a ```*``` mark, it means that your ReSpeaker has successfully connected to your Wi-Fi network. Tap ```Esc``` key twice to leave the network manager config tool.

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Respeaker_V2/raw/master/img/nmtui1-2.png)

Now find the IP address of your ReSpeaker by using the command below.

```
ip address
```
In the example below, we can see that this ReSpeaker's IP address is ```192.168.7.108```

```
root@v2:/home/respeaker# ip address

1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

    inet6 fe80::64de:cac8:65ef:aac8/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```


In addition to the Networ Manager GUI interface, Network Manager also has a command line tool. If you are connecting to a hidden Wi-Fi network, you'll need to use this command line tool:

```
nmcli c add type wifi con-name mywifi ifname wlan0 ssid your_wifi_ssid
nmcli con modify mywifi wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-psk
nmcli con modify mywifi wifi-sec.psk your_wifi_password
nmcli con up mywifi
```

**B. Ethernet Connectivity**

You can connect to a network using an Ethernet cable. Just plug the Ethernet cable which has connected to the Internet will be OK.




**Connect to SSH & VNC**

**A. SSH**

SSH server starts automatically in ReSpeaker v2.0. For Windows Users, third-party SSH clients are available. For Linux/Mac Users, SSH client is built in.

- Windows: Use PUTTY, select SSH protocol, fill in correct IP address and click open. Login as respeaker user and password is respeaker too.

- Linux/Mac:
```
ssh respeaker@192.168.***.***
// password: respeaker
```

<div class="admonition note" >
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
Note that if experience slow performance using SSH, please switch to a less crowded WiFi network.
</div>

**B. VNC**

In order to acquire the authorization from Alexa, you need to use VNC Viewer. The system has VNC server built-in. The VNC server will launch the **lxqt** desktop GUI which is a lightweight Qt desktop environment.
The VNC service also starts automatically. Use [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/) or [VNC Viewer for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vnc%C2%AE-viewer-for-google-ch/iabmpiboiopbgfabjmgeedhcmjenhbla?hl=en) to connect to the desktop of ReSpeaker Core v2.0.

To use VNC, connect your PC/Mac and ReSpeaker v2.0 to the same Wi-Fi network. Then open VNC Viewer, type ```192.168.xxx.xxx``` at the address bar. ```192.168.xxx.xxx``` is IP address of the board，you can use the command **ifconfig** to check. If you meet ```Unencrypted connection```, click Continue to go on. The password is ```respeaker```.

<div class="admonition note" >
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
Please note that the VNC connection relies on good quality of the network, please have a mental preparation that you will probably get very low refresh rate of the VNC display.
</div>

**Connect to Speaker or Headset**

The board uses the built-in codec of the SOC to render playback. Both the JST speaker port and the headset port are driven by their own amplifier, and both amplifiers are connected to the same codec of the SOC. The sound card driver that SEEED implemented drives both the capture device and the playback device. So there's no discrete capture or playback sound card in ALSA device list. They're all named seeed-8mic-voicecard.

The simplest way to heard sound from the board is to plugin a headset. If you prefer loud speaker, the board can output up to 8W of drive capability.



**Bluetooth Setting Up**

**Activate the bluetooth**

Please tap the commands below to update and activate the Bluetooth of ReSpeaker Core v2.0:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-mark hold firefox 
sudo apt upgrade
```

<div class="admonition note" >
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
If update fails, please change to another WiFi with good network condition and do the update again.
</div>

Then activate the bluetooth by the command:

```
sudo systemctl enable bt-auto-connect.service
sudo reboot -f
```

**Using the ReSpeaker Core v2.0 as a Bluetooth Speaker-Slave Device**

When the ReSpeaker Core v2.0 restart, open the bluetooth of your phone or computer, you will find a bluetooth device called **ReSpeaker-xxxx**.
Choose and connect to it. Plug a speaker or headset into the ReSpeaker Core v2.0 then play music and enjoy your bluetooth speaker.

**Using the ReSpeaker Core v2.0 as a Bluetooth Player-Master Device**

In addition to just working as a bluetooth speaker, it can also serve as a bluetooth player to hack your bluetooth headset or bluetooth speaker.
OK, let's hacking.

- **Step 1.** Tap `bluetoothctl` to open the bluetooth shell.

- **Step 2.** Tap `scan on` to scan your bluetooth device.

- **Step 3.** When the ReSpeaker Core v2.0 find your target device, tap `scan off`.
For this wiki, say, MDR-1000X headset is our target, mark the device ID Device `04:5D:4B:81:35:84`.

```

```

If `Connection successful` pops up, configuration!

You can tap `exit` or `quit` to exit the shell, then use the commands below to test your bluetooth device.

```
arecord bluetoothtest.wav
aplay bluetoothtest.wav

```


**Record and Play**

**1.Test via ALSA**

As this is a technical documentation of development phase, the index of the sound device may change along versions. So check out the correct device index first with the following commands:

```
respeaker@v2:~$ arecord -l
**** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****
card 0: seeed8micvoicec [seeed-8mic-voicecard], device 0: 100b0000.i2s1-ac108-pcm0 ac108-pcm0-0 []
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0

respeaker@v2:~$ aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: seeed8micvoicec [seeed-8mic-voicecard], device 1: 100b0000.i2s1-rk3228-hifi rk3228-hifi-1 []
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0

```

Find the sound card whose name has **seeed** prefix. For the example above, the capture device is **hw:0,0**, which means card **0**/device **0**.
The playback device is **hw:0,1**, which means card **0**/device **1**.. Then test recording and playing sound with the following commands:

```
# record & playback 2 channels audio
arecord -Dhw:0,0 -f S16_LE -r 16000 -c 2 hello.wav
aplay -Dhw:0,1 -r 16000 -c 2 hello.wav

# If you want to output the sound by the bluetooth device, you need to use the command below to play
aplay -r 16000 -c 2 hello.wav

# record 8 channels audio
# there are 6 microphones on board, and ac108 compose the 2 remaining channels.
arecord -Dhw:0,0 -f S16_LE -r 16000 -c 8 hello_8ch.wav
```

Besides you can record and play at the same time.

```
arecord | aplay
```


**2. Test via PulseAudio**

First check whether the PulseAudio is running:

```
respeaker@v2:~$ ps aux|grep pulse|grep -v grep
respeak+  1109  0.0  0.7 363272  7932 ?        S<l  01:01   0:00 /usr/bin/pulseaudio --start --log-target=syslog
```
If it's not, please refer to PulseAudio's documentation to enable the auto-spawn of PulseAudio. Then test via:
```
parecord --channels=8 --rate=16000 --format=s16le hello2.wav
paplay hello2.wav
```
Further more, the default ALSA device now hooks to PulseAudio, so using the following commands also plays/records sound via PulseAudio:
```
arecord -v -f cd hello3.wav
aplay hello3.wav
```

So far we learned the basic operations of the ReSpeaker Core v2.0 board, let's move forward. We can use ReSpeaker Core v2.0 to build our own AVS(Alexa Voice Service) device or Dueros(Voice assistance of Baidu) device.




### Out of Box Demo

This part including a close-sourced solution based on librespeaker. The librespeaker is an audio processing library which can perform:

- Noise suppression
- Direction of arrival calculation
- Beamforming
- Hotword searching
- Acoustic echo cancellation

It reads the microphone stream from linux sound server, e.g. PulseAudio. It exposes a few APIs which enable users to get indicated when hotword is said and the processed microphone data in PCM format, which then can be sent to cloud services like Alexa for further processing.

Before experiencing this powerful solution, please make sure you have done all the things below.

- System image burning - this demo needs the lxqt version system image
- Get serial console via OTG USB port
- Setup Wi-Fi / ethernet
- SSH
- VNC

OK, let's play.

Actually it's simple and easy. We've made a one-click installation script. For more detail about this solution and step by step configuration, please refer to [here](https://github.com/respeaker/respeakerd)

**Step 1. Download packages**
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/respeaker/respeakerd/master/scripts/install_all.sh|bash
```

When prompt, type in the sudo password for user respeaker: respeaker. Wait the script install some packages.


**Step 2. Authorize Alexa**

Connect to the board via [VNC](https://github.com/respeaker/get_started_with_respeaker/blob/master/docs/ReSpeaker_Core_V2/getting_started.md#ssh--vnc). In the VNC desktop, open the Internet Browser, and tap `127.0.0.1:3000` at the URL input field . The web browser will display a login page. Sign in with your Amazon account:

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Respeaker_V2/raw/master/img/aus-1.png)

After succeed you will see:

![](https://github.com/respeaker/get_started_with_respeaker/raw/master/img/aus-2.png)

Now you can close the VNC client. The following commands can be executed in the SSH (If you prefer the VNC desktop, the terminal in VNC desktop also works).


**Step 3. Run the demo**

When finished the steps above, run:

```
python /home/respeaker/respeakerd/clients/Python/demo_respeaker_v2_vep_alexa_with_light.py
```

Say `snowboy`, wake up Alexa, Enjoy！

<div class="admonition note" >
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
One more thing, do you see the colorful LEDs on the back of ReSpeaker Core v2.0? Look carefully at the green LED, haha, you find it. Yes the green led just point to the voice directly, as you known, DOA.</div>



## Closed source solution



[![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Respeaker_V2/raw/master/img/alango.jpg)](http://www.alango.com)


The close source solution utilizes two algorithms provided by Alango: Beam-forming (BF) and Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC).


### APIs for Librespeaker

Librespeaker is an audio processing library which can perform noise suppression, direction of arrival calculation, beamforming, hotword searching. It reads the microphoone stream from linux sound server, e.g. PulseAudio.

**Keyword wake-up**

**BF (Beam-Forming)**

  - The main role is to enhance the signal to noise ratio of the microphone
  - Only listen to sounds in a certain direction

**DoA (Direction of arrival)**

  - Showing the direction of the sound through the LED light ring


**NS (Noise suppression)**

  - Filter the noise introduced by the circuit
  - Filter out the steady-state noise in the environment, such as the sound of an electric fan.



**AEC (Acoustic echo cancellation)**

  - Remove the sound produced by the speaker itself from the sound collected by the microphone.


**AGC (Automatic gain control)**

  - Automatically adjust the volume of the microphone, maximize the pickup capability of microphone.


And we provide several APIs which enable users to get indicated when hotword is said and the processed microphone data in PCM format, which then can be sent to cloud services like Alexa for further processing. You can click [APIs Docs](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/librespeaker_doc/) to check.


### Play with AVS


**C++**

This guide will show you how to run the Amazon official AVS C++ SDK with respeakerd. And this part requires you to have a certain technical background about Linux.

**Part 1. Preparation**

If you've already passed the [Out of Box demo](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_Core_v2.0/#out-of-box-demo), please move forward to next chapter.

If you just received the board and had done nothing on it, please learn the [Basic Operations](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_Core_v2.0/#preparation) of this board:

- System image burning - this demo needs the lxqt version system image
- Get serial console via OTG USB port
- Setup Wi-Fi / ethernet
- SSH
- VNC

Then install the basic software packages with the following command, when you see the prompt "When you finish that, the script will continue, or press Ctrl+C if you've done this before", just press Ctrl + C to interrupt the script.

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/respeaker/respeakerd/master/scripts/install_all.sh|bash
```

This will install `librespeaker` and `respeakerd`.

**Part 2. Configure respeakerd**

Use your favorite text editor to edit `/etc/respeaker/respeakerd.conf`, in this wiki we use **vim editor**.

```
sudo vim /etc/respeaker/respeakerd.conf

```

Then change the `mode` to `pulse`

```
# mode
# the mode of respeakerd, can be: standard, pulse
mode = pulse
```

We need to restart the `respeakerd` service

```
sudo systemctl start respeakerd
```

Or you want to manually start the respeakerd for debugging purpose:

```
sudo systemctl stop respeakerd
/usr/bin/respeakerd --source="alsa_input.platform-sound_0.seeed-8ch" --mode=pulse --debug
```

<div class="admonition note" >
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
​You can specify any configuration items inside the configuration file /etc/respeaker/respeakerd.conf on the command line to overwrite the corresponding configuration items in the configuration file. You can also inspect all the command line options with respeakerd --help.</div>

**Part 3. Compile and Run AVS C++ SDK**

3.1 Download and install the necessary files

```
cd ~ && mkdir sdk-folder && cd sdk-folder && mkdir sdk-build sdk-source third-party application-necessities && cd application-necessities && mkdir sound-files
sudo apt-get -y install git gcc cmake build-essential libsqlite3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libfaad-dev libsoup2.4-dev libgcrypt20-dev libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-good libasound2-dev doxygen
cd ~/sdk-folder/third-party && wget -c http://www.portaudio.com/archives/pa_stable_v190600_20161030.tgz && tar zxf pa_stable_v190600_20161030.tgz && cd portaudio && ./configure --without-jack && make
sudo pip install commentjson
sudo pip install flask
cd ~/sdk-folder/sdk-source && git clone git://github.com/respeaker/avs-device-sdk.git
cd ~/sdk-folder/sdk-build && cmake /home/respeaker/sdk-folder/sdk-source/avs-device-sdk -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG -DRESPEAKERD_KEY_WORD_DETECTOR=ON -DGSTREAMER_MEDIA_PLAYER=ON -DPORTAUDIO=ON -DPORTAUDIO_LIB_PATH=/home/respeaker/sdk-folder/third-party/portaudio/lib/.libs/libportaudio.a -DPORTAUDIO_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/respeaker/sdk-folder/third-party/portaudio/include
make SampleApp -j2

```

3.2 Get Authorization of AVS

In this section we are going to setup and run a local authorization server, which we'll use to obtain a refresh token. This refresh token, along with your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are exchanged for an access token, which the sample app needs to send to Alexa with each event (request).

Step 1. Register your product with Amazon

First of all, please follow these [instructions](https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/wiki/Create-Security-Profile) to register your product and create a security profile. You can skip this step if you have a registered product you'd like to test with.

<div class="admonition note" >
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
Make sure you save the **Product ID** from the **Product information** tab, and your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the **Security Profile** tab. You'll need these params to configure the authorization server.</div>


Step 2. Update AlexaClientSDKConfig.json


Open `/home/respeaker/sdk-folder/sdk-build/Integration/AlexaClientSDKConfig.json` by the command below.

```
vim ~/sdk-folder/sdk-build/Integration/AlexaClientSDKConfig.json

```

Replace the contents of AlexaClientSDKConfig.json with this JSON blob:

```
{
    "authDelegate":{
        "clientSecret":"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
        "deviceSerialNumber":"123456",
        "refreshToken":"",
        "clientId":"YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        "productId":"YOUR_PRODUCT_ID"
   },
   "alertsCapabilityAgent":{
        "databaseFilePath":"/home/respeaker/sdk-folder/application-necessities/alerts.db"
   },
   "settings":{
        "databaseFilePath":"/home/respeaker/sdk-folder/application-necessities/settings.db",
        "defaultAVSClientSettings":{
            "locale":"en-US"
        }
   },
   "certifiedSender":{
        "databaseFilePath":"/home/respeaker/sdk-folder/application-necessities/certifiedSender.db"
   },
   "notifications":{
       "databaseFilePath":"/home/respeaker/sdk-folder/application-necessities/notifications.db"
   }
}

```

Enter the **clientId**, **clientSecret**, and **productId** that you saved during device registration and save.

<div class="admonition Warning" >
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
​Do not remove the quotes and make sure there are no extra characters or spaces! The required values are strings. And It is a good idea to save a backup of this file. Subsequent builds may overwrite the values in **AlexaClientSDKConfig.json**.</div>

<div class="admonition note" >
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
​deviceSerialNumber is pre-populated for this project, however, a commercial product should use a serial number or other unique identified for the device.</div>

<div class="admonition Tip" >
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
​The locale is set to US English by default in the sample JSON, however other [locales are supported](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-voice-service/settings.html#settingsupdated). Feel free to test each language.</div>


Step 3. Obtain a refresh token

After you've updated **AlexaClientSDKConfig.json**, run **AuthServer.py** to kick-off the token exchange:

```
cd ~/sdk-folder/sdk-build && python AuthServer/AuthServer.py

```

<div class="admonition note" >
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
You may need to change the locale settings for your ReSpeaker, as some Raspbian images default to **amazon.co.uk** to **amazon.com**.</div>


Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. Login with your Amazon credentials and follow the instructions provided.

![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f4d1060ce3223a028af83c4743b4caee28ff107d/68747470733a2f2f6d2e6d656469612d616d617a6f6e2e636f6d2f696d616765732f472f30312f6d6f62696c652d617070732f6465782f6176732f73646b2f332e706e67253232)

Step 4. AVS configuration test

Tap the command below to test the AVS configuration.

```
~/sdk-folder/sdk-build/SampleApp/src/SampleApp ~/sdk-folder/sdk-build/Integration/AlexaClientSDKConfig.json

```
If everything goes well, you will see the **Sample APP**. Now you are able to make conversations with Alexa, but all user experiences are done through the command line messages.

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Respeaker_V2/raw/master/img/SDK_app.png)



**Part 4. LED Ring Light Effect**

To activate the on-board LED effect, you just need to tap commands below.

```
sudo cp -f ~/respeakerd/scripts/pixel_ring_server /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/pixel_ring_server
pixel_ring_server

```
Now you will see the LED rings shining and running.


**Part 5. Startup**

When this part done you will be able to wake up the ReSpeaker Core v2.0 by key word.

Tap the commands below.

```
sudo cp -f ~/respeakerd/scripts/avs_cpp_sdk_safe /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/avs_cpp_sdk_safe
sudo cp -f ~/respeakerd/scripts/pixel_ring_server.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp -f ~/respeakerd/scripts/avs_cpp_sdk.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable pixel_ring_server
sudo systemctl enable avs_cpp_sdk
sudo systemctl start pixel_ring_server
sudo systemctl start avs_cpp_sdk

```

Finally, just call `Snowboy`, and he will return you a big surprise! Enjoy!

### Play with AVS

This guide will shows you how to build an AVS device based on the ReSpeaker Core V2.0.


- **Step 1. Install AVS library (Python)**

```
sudo apt update
pip install avs
```

This will also install the following executables into **~/.local/bin**: alexa-audio-check, alexa-auth, dueros-auth, alexa-tap and alexa.

Tap the command below to Check the audio configuration:
```
~/.local/bin/alexa-audio-check
```
This script calculates the RMS of the sound recorded by the microphones.

- **Step 2. Authorize Alexa**

Connect to the board via [VNC](https://github.com/respeaker/get_started_with_respeaker/blob/master/docs/ReSpeaker_Core_V2/getting_started.md#ssh--vnc). In the VNC desktop, open terminal and execute:

```
~/.local/bin/alexa-auth
```
This script will open the web browser automatically, the web browser will display a login page. Sign in with your Amazon account:

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Respeaker_V2/raw/master/img/aus-1.png)

After succeed you will see:

![](https://github.com/respeaker/get_started_with_respeaker/raw/master/img/aus-2.png)

Now you can close the VNC client. The following commands can be executed in the SSH (If you prefer the VNC desktop, the terminal in VNC desktop also works).

- **Step 3. Have fun with Alexa Applications**

We provide three python files based on Alexa, you can choose them freely.

  - Alexa-tap.py : Use the **Enter** key to wakeup Alexa, we call it Alexa Tap to Play.
  - ns_kws_alexa.py : Use the key word **Alexa** to wakeup Alexa, we call it Alexa Hands-Free.
  - ns_kws_alexa_with_light.py : The same as ns_kws_alexa.py, add the LED effect, We call it Alexa with light.

**Alexa Tap to Play**
Tap the command below in the terminal Of Putty(SSH is recommended).
```
~/.local/bin/alexa-tap
```

Wait until you see **on_ready** in the log printing. Press **Enter** key of your computer and talk to Alexa(Only support English now).

**Alexa Hands-Free with Snowboy**

```
sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev                # required by snowboy
git clone https://github.com/respeaker/respeaker_v2_eval.git
cd respeaker_v2_eval
pip install --no-deps snowboy*.whl           # install pre-build snowboy
pip install webrtc_audio_processing*.whl
pip install voice-engine
python ns_kws_alexa.py
```
Wait until you see **on_ready** in the log printing, say **Alexa** to trigger the conversation with Alexa.

**Alexa with Light Effect**

```
pip install pixel-ring
python ns_kws_alexa_with_light.py
```
The same as last one, say **Alexa** to trigger the conversation with Alexa. You will see the LED shinning while this program is running.


- **Step 4. DOA(Direction of Arrival)**

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/voice-engine/voice-engine.git
cd ~/voice-engine/examples
python kws_doa_alexa_respeaker_v2.py
```

Here is the output.

```
['arecord', '-t', 'raw', '-f', 'S16_LE', '-c', '8', '-r', '16000', '-D', 'default', '-q']
detected 1 at direction 237.455170747
detected 1 at direction 223.32811392
detected 1 at direction 223.32811392
detected 1 at direction 237.455170747
detected 1 at direction 237.455170747
```


### Play with Dueros

The same as AVS, the only difference is that you need to delete one profile file. Before [get the authorization](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_Core_v2.0/#step-2-authorize-alexa),
you should tap the command below to delete the **avs.json**.

```
rm -f ~/.avs.json
```
Then you can get the authorization from Baidu by tapping the following command:

```
~/.local/bin/dueros-auth
```
![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Respeaker_V2/raw/master/img/dueros.jpg)



After login, the following step is the same as AVS, Please refer to [AVS Demos](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_Core_v2.0/#step-3-have-fun-with-alexa-applications).

When you run the python program, you can say **Alexa** to wake up the Baidu voice assistance.



### Play with Google Assistant


Please refer to our wiki [Google Assistant](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Google_Assistant). Follow the instruction step by step, then you will be able to use Google Assistant.


## Play with online STT

This part will introduce Bing/Baidu STT(Speech to Text) functions together with pocketsphinx. 

**1. Bing STT**

- **Step 1. Install dependiencies**

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

## Play with GPIO

This part will introduce how to use **MRAA** and **UPM** to control GPIO and Grove Socket on Respeaker Core v2.0.

- **Step 1. Update MRAA and UPM libraries to latest version**

At first, we need to install the latest MRAA and UPM packages.

```
sudo apt install  python-mraa python-upm libmraa1 libupm1 mraa-tools
```

- **Step 2. Check your platform information**


```
#only have bus 0 and id=03(/dev/i2c-3), 0 is the i2c number for mraa and upm
respeaker@v2:~$ mraa-i2c list
Bus   0: id=03 type=linux

#mraa gpio numbers and system gpio numbers and it's pinmux
respeaker@v2:~$ mraa-gpio list
00      GPIO91: GPIO
01         VCC:
02      GPIO43: GPIO
03     GPIO127: GPIO
04      GPIO17: GPIO
05      GPIO67: GPIO
06         GND:
07      GPIO13: GPIO
08    I2C2_SCL: I2C  
09    I2C2_SDA: I2C  
10         VCC:
11         GND:
12      GPIO66: GPIO
```
The description of the PIN defines for the ReSpeaker Core v2.0 board please refer to [Pin Out]()


- **Step 3. Demos with MRAA or UPM**

**A. Use MRAA Library**


**Control GPIO Directly**

Connect the Grove PIR sensor's **SIG** pin to the ReSpeaker Core v2.0's header pin **0** with jumper. Don't forget to wire the VCC and GND at the same time. Then tap the code below into your console

``` python
respeaker@v2:~$ python
Python 2.7.13 (default, Jan 19 2017, 14:48:08)
[GCC 6.3.0 20170118] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import mraa
>>> x = mraa.Gpio(0)
>>> x.dir(mraa.DIR_OUT)
0
>>> x.write(0)
0
>>> x.write(1)
0
>>>
```
When you tap **x.write(1)**,you will heard a scream from the buzzer.


**PIR Motion Sensor example**


Materials

| ReSpeaker Core v2.0 |  Grove -  PIR Motion Sensor |
|--------------|-------------|
|![enter image description here](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Respeaker_V2/raw/master/img/ReSpeaker_V2_back_little.jpg)|![enter image description here](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Respeaker_V2/raw/master/img/Grove%20-%20PIR%20Motion%20Sensor.jpg)|

In this example, we're gonna to listen on the trigger of the Grove PIR sensor, in Python code.
Connect the Grove PIR sensor's **D1** pin to the ReSpeaker Core v2.0's header pin **0** with jumper. Don't forget to wire the VCC and GND at the same time.
Then copy the code below into a new file and save it as a python file, name as **mraa_pir.py**. Copy this file into your ReSpeaker Core v2.0.

``` python
import mraa

def on_trigger(gpio):
    print("pin " + repr(gpio.getPin(True)) + " = " + repr(gpio.read()))

pin = 0

try:
    x = mraa.Gpio(pin)
    print("Starting ISR for pin " + repr(pin))
    x.dir(mraa.DIR_IN)
    # respeaker v2 only support EDGE_BOTH
    x.isr(mraa.EDGE_BOTH, on_trigger, x)
    var = raw_input("Press ENTER to stop")
    x.isrExit()
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)

```

Then run the code with the command below.(make sure you have located in the folder which contains the mraa_pir.py you've just saved)

``` python
sudo python mraa_pir.py
```

The result will be like
```
$ sudo python mraa_pir.py
Starting ISR for pin 0
Press ENTER to stoppin 1091 = 0
pin 1091 = 0
pin 1091 = 1
...
```


**B. Use UPM Library**

The UPM project implements sensors' driver based on the MRAA library, so we no longer need to care about the GPIO programming or what the I2C address of a sensor, all the default informations and logics for a particular sensor has been wrapped into a UPM library. UPM has supported bunch of sensors. https://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/modules.html. But please note that we didnt confirm every sensor works on the ReSpeaker Core v2.0.

**Example for Grove Digital Light Sensor**


Materials

| ReSpeaker Core v2 |  Grove - Digital Light Sensor |
|--------------|-------------|
|![enter image description here](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Respeaker_V2/raw/master/img/ReSpeaker_V2_back_little.jpg)|![enter image description here](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Respeaker_V2/raw/master/img/Digital_Light_Sensor.jpg)|

This is an example for the Grove Digital Light Sensor, which is copied from the UPM github repo.

Please plug the PIR Motion Sensor into your Respeaker Core v2.0 via the Grove socket.
Then copy the code below into a new file and save it as a python file, name as **tsl2561.py**. Copy this file into your ReSpeaker Core v2.0.

from __future__ import print_function
import time, sys, signal, atexit
from upm import pyupm_tsl2561 as upmTsl2561

def main():
    # Instantiate a digital light sensor TSL2561 on I2C
    myDigitalLightSensor = upmTsl2561.TSL2561()

    ## Exit handlers ##
    # This function stops python from printing a stacktrace when you hit control-C
    def SIGINTHandler(signum, frame):

    def exitHandler():
        print("Exiting")
        sys.exit(0)

    # Register exit handlers
    atexit.register(exitHandler)
    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, SIGINTHandler)

    while(1):
        print("Light value is " + str(myDigitalLightSensor.getLux()))
        time.sleep(1)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The result should be something like:

``` python
respeaker@v2:~$ python tsl2561.py       
Light value is 0
Light value is 38
Light value is 20
Light value is 54
Light value is 13
Light value is 44
Light value is 31  
```

## Librespeaker Aduio Process

Librespeaker is an audio processing library which can perform noise suppression, direction of arrival calculation, beamforming, hotword searching. It reads the microphoone stream from linux sound server, e.g. PulseAudio.

Here is the list of examples in [Librespeaker Documentation](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/librespeaker_doc/examples.html). These examples will help you understand how to make different applications with librespeaker. 

### Install librespeaker
 
```shell
sudo apt install -y librespeaker-dev libsndfile1-dev libasound2-dev 
# Reboot to make configuration effective
sudo reboot 
```

### Librespeaker Examples

First of all, as an audio processing application, we always have to collect audio stream. In librespeaker, we have 3 ways to capture audio stream: PulseAudio Server, ALSA API and a wav file.


**1. PulseAudio Server**

PulseAudio is a sound system for POSIX OSes, meaning that it is a proxy for your sound applications. It allows you to do advanced operations on your sound data as it passes between your application and your hardware.

- Step1. Check PulseAudio Status  

Run **pactl info**, You will see the output as below. 

```
respeaker@v2:~$ pactl info
Server String: /run/user/1000/pulse/native
Library Protocol Version: 33
Server Protocol Version: 33
Is Local: yes
Client Index: 5
Tile Size: 65496
User Name: respeaker
Host Name: v2
Server Name: pulseaudio
Server Version: 12.2.0-rebootstrapped
Default Sample Specification: s16le 2ch 48000Hz
Default Channel Map: front-left,front-right
Default Sink: alsa_output.platform-sound_0.seeed-2ch
Default Source: alsa_input.platform-sound_0.seeed-8ch
Cookie: 971b:7ffb
```

- Step2. C++ Coding

The example [pulse_snowboy_1b_test.cc](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/librespeaker_doc/pulse_snowboy_1b_test_8cc-example.html) shows how to use the VepAecBeamformingNode node, the Snowboy1bDoaKwsNode node and the ReSpeaker supervisor, to make a simple snowboy KWS demo. This example supports keyword "alexa" and "snowboy", adjustable target gain level and wav log.


```shell
cd ~
#copy above link code to pulse_snowboy_1b_test.cc, then press Ctrl+X, and Y to save the file.
nano pulse_snowboy_1b_test.cc
# compile
g++ pulse_snowboy_1b_test.cc -o pulse_snowboy_1b_test -lrespeaker -lsndfile -fPIC -std=c++11 -fpermissive -I/usr/include/respeaker/ -DWEBRTC_LINUX -DWEBRTC_POSIX -DWEBRTC_NS_FLOAT -DWEBRTC_APM_DEBUG_DUMP=0 -DWEBRTC_INTELLIGIBILITY_ENHANCER=0
# run, then say "snowboy" to test the KWS engine
./pulse_snowboy_1b_test
# show the help page of this example
./pulse_snowboy_1b_test --help
```

Here is the output as below. We can see the DOA as 180, hotword dectect count as 2 times, the major audio comes from channel 2. 

```

hotword_count = 2
```

!!!Note
    If you need to see the process audio, you can set **bool enable_wav = false;** to true. Then you can get **pulse_snowboy_1b_test.wav** processed audio file.

**2. ALSA API**

ALSA stands for Advanced Linux Sound Architecture. It provides audio and MIDI functionality to the Linux operating system. If you want a more efficient(low latency and low CPU consumption) way to capture voice, ALSA will be your choice.

- Step1. Audio Setting 

If pulseaudio is running, the output of the **ps aux|grep pulse** will be as below. 

```shell
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ps aux|grep pulse
pi         978  0.1  0.9 112456  9236 ?        S<l  18:48   0:01 /usr/bin/pulseaudio --start --log-target=syslog
pi        1247  0.0  0.0   4376   564 pts/0    S+   18:57   0:00 grep --color=auto pulse
```

please make sure that **pulseaudio is not running** by below commands: 

```shell
$ pulseaudio --k
$ ps aux|grep pulse
pi        1355  0.0  0.0   4376   568 pts/0    S+   16:48   0:00 grep --color=auto pulse
```
    
- Step2. C++ Coding

The example [alsa_snips_1b_test.cc](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/librespeaker_doc/alsa_snips_1b_test_8cc-example.html) shows how to use the AlsaCollectorNode node with VepAecBeamformingNode node and Snips1bDoaKwsNode node.


```shell
cd ~
#copy above link code to alsa_snips_1b_test.cc, then press Ctrl+X, and Y to save the file.
nano alsa_snips_1b_test.cc
# compile
g++ alsa_snips_1b_test.cc -o alsa_snips_1b_test -lrespeaker -lsndfile -fPIC -std=c++11 -fpermissive -I/usr/include/respeaker/ -DWEBRTC_LINUX -DWEBRTC_POSIX -DWEBRTC_NS_FLOAT -DWEBRTC_APM_DEBUG_DUMP=0 -DWEBRTC_INTELLIGIBILITY_ENHANCER=0
# run, then say "hey, snips" to test the KWS engine
./alsa_snips_1b_test
# show the help page of this example
./alsa_snips_1b_test --help
```

Here is the output as below. We can see the DOA as 180, hotword dectect count as 3 times, the major audio comes from channel 2. 

```
collector: 3, vep_1beam: 0, snips_kws: 0
collector: 3, vep_1beam: 0, snips_kws: 0
collector: 3, vep_1beam: 0, snips_kws: 0

hotword_count = 3
```

**3. WAV FILE**

If you need to test the performance of KWS, ASR, NLP or something else, it is not a good way to test it with your mouth repeatly. It is recommanded to record a testing recording first, and just send the recording to your program to get the result.

[file_1beam_test.cc](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/librespeaker_doc/file_1beam_test_8cc-example.html) shows how to read a 8-channels 16K 16-bit wav file, send the recording stream to VepAecBeamformingNode node and detect hotword from the output beam. This example supports keyword "alexa", "snowboy" and "heysnips", adjustable target gain level and wav log.


```shell
cd ~
#copy above link code to file_1beam_test.cc, then press Ctrl+X, and Y to save the file.
nano file_1beam_test.cc
# compile
g++ file_1beam_test.cc -o file_1beam_test -lrespeaker -lsndfile -fPIC -std=c++11 -fpermissive -I/usr/include/respeaker/ -DWEBRTC_LINUX -DWEBRTC_POSIX -DWEBRTC_NS_FLOAT -DWEBRTC_APM_DEBUG_DUMP=0 -DWEBRTC_INTELLIGIBILITY_ENHANCER=0
# record a testing wav file to test keyword "snowboy"
arecord -Dhw:0,0 -f S16_LE -r 16000 -c 8 my_test.wav
# run
./file_1beam_test -f my_test.wav
# you need to press Ctrl+C to exit when the log is stopped
```

Here is the output as below. We can see the DOA as 180, hotword dectect count as 3 times, the major audio comes from channel 2.

hotword_count = 3
```


**4. Another way to output processed audio: ALOOP** 

AloopOutputNode is designed to redirect the processed audio stream into a specific Alsa device(Loopback PCM). In this way, some third-party voice assistants can get  real-time processed audio stream from a PCM device, which provides a convenient way to build your application.

[alsa_aloop_test.cc](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/librespeaker_doc/alsa_aloop_test_8cc-example.html) shows how to achieve it. To run this example, you have to run 'sudo modprobe snd-aloop' first. And make sure "pulseaudio" doesn't start, then, after runing this example, you can open another terminal and use `arecord -Dhw:Loopback,1,0 -c 1 -r 16000 -f S16_LE loop_test.wav` to arecord the processed audio stream. Further more, you can setup a third party voice assistant to capture voice from "hw:Loopback,1,0", to run the assistant directly. Check [respeaker::AloopOutputNode Class Reference](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/librespeaker_doc/classrespeaker_1_1AloopOutputNode.html) for more details of this node.

## Respeakerd Aduio Process

Respeakerd is the server application for the microphone array solutions of SEEED, based on librespeaker which combines the audio front-end processing algorithms.

The guide of respeakerd can be found at [here](https://github.com/respeaker/respeakerd/tree/master). Download that repository to your Pi. Don't forget to do `Alexa authorization` and update avs `sudo pip install -U avs` before you run python client of respeakerd `python ~/respeakerd/clients/Python/demo_pi_vep_alexa.py`.




## FAQs

**Q1: How to change the senstivity of the wake up word?**

**A1:** 


<div class="admonition note" >
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
This way to adjust the sensitivity is only for the Out of box demo. 
</div>


When you finish the Out of box demo, you may find the `Snowboy` is hard to wake up. You can modify the following file to adjust the sensitivity.


```
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/respeakerd_safe
```

You will see the following code. 

```PYTHON
#!/bin/bash

pulseaudio --check

while [ $? == 1 ]; do
    sleep 1
    pulseaudio --check
done

sleep 5

/usr/local/bin/respeakerd --snowboy_res_path="/usr/local/etc/respeakerd/resources/common.res" --snowboy_model_path="/usr/local/etc/respeakerd/resources/snowboy.umdl" --snowboy_sensitivity="0.4" --source="alsa_input.platform-sound_0.seeed-8ch"
```

Find the `snowboy_sensitivity="0.4"`, the default valnue is `0.4`. The sensitivity range is 0.1-0.9, the larger the number, the higher the sensitivity. However, the probability of false triggering is also higher. For example, change the `0.4` to `0.6`, then press ++ctrl+x++ to save and quit. 

Then tap
```
sudo reboot
```


Call `snowboy` to check.


**Q2: How to change the wake up words?**

**A2**

step 1. Please go to the official web of [Snowboy](https://snowboy.kitt.ai/dashboard). Login in with your google ID or Github ID or just create one. 


step 2. Then click `Create Hotword`, or just pick an existing `pmdl` file to download.

Step 3. Copy the `pmdl` file into the following location of ReSpeaker Core v2.0 `/usr/local/etc/respeakerd/resources/`. You can use the command below to see.

```
cd /usr/local/etc/respeakerd/resources/
ls

```

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Respeaker_V2/raw/master/img/Q2.png)


Step 4. Choose the hot word by modifying the congfig file.

```
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/respeakerd_safe

```

Find the `snowboy_model_path="/usr/local/etc/respeakerd/resources/snowboy.umdl"`, in this demo we use `jiojio.pmdl`, so we change it to `snowboy_model_path="/usr/local/etc/respeakerd/resources/jiojio.pmdl"`.
You can change it with your own file.Then it should be something like:


```PYTHON
#!/bin/bash

pulseaudio --check

while [ $? == 1 ]; do
    sleep 1
    pulseaudio --check
done

sleep 5

/usr/local/bin/respeakerd --snowboy_res_path="/usr/local/etc/respeakerd/resources/common.res" --snowboy_model_path="/usr/local/etc/respeakerd/resources/jiojio.pmdl" --snowboy_sensitivity="0.4" --source="alsa_input.platform-sound_0.seeed-8ch"
```

Then save and exit.And reboot with:

```
sudo reboot
```

Once the ReSpeaker Core v2.0 reboot, you can wake up it with your own hot word.


Tip!!!
​    The defualt file is **umdl** which is released by the snowboy company,and the file you created is **pmdl** which means personal.





**Q3: How to record and play with Audacity?**

  **A3:** The **lxqt** version has pre-installed Audacity, Please click the **Bird button** at the lower left corner, and you will find it at the **Sound & Video -> Audacity**.

  When you opened the Audacity, please click the little black arrow to choose the record and play device and set as the picture below.

  ![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Respeaker_V2/raw/master/img/audacity.png)

  You should choose Seeed-8mic-voicecard for both record and play device. And you can choose 1/2/4/6/8 channels to record and play. As you can see,
  there are 8 channels in the picture, however there are no data in channel 7 and 8. That is because this two channels are the playback channel.
  The channel 7 is for 3.5mm Headphone and the channel 8 for the JST2.0 Speaker (If you do not have a JST cable, you can use jumpers as well). Say, we use JST Speaker:

  - Step 1. Set as the picture above, click the **Record** button, record a period audio.
  - Step 2. Click the **Stop** button, then you will see channel 7 and 8 are empty.
  - Step 3. Click **Record** button again, this time you will find Channel 8 changed.

**Q7: The computer can not recognize the ReSpeaker Core v2.0, driver problem?**

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Respeaker_V2/raw/master/img/CDC_Driver.png)

**A7:** This may happen when you connect the ReSpeaker Core v2.0 with you computer via OTG or UART.
This is because the CDC Serial driver has a conflict with other OTG driver. Please uninstall the conflicted driver
 and connect the ReSpeaker Core v2.0 again.

**Q8: What if I want to use the external antenna?**

**A8:** The ReSpeaker Core v2.0 use **AP6212** to provide both WiFi and Bluetooth, they share the same antenna.
Instead of the on-board antenna, you can use an external antenna. To do so, you need to remove one resistance and solder it
on the new pads, as shown below：

- First you need to remove the resistance in the orange box.
- Then please solder it on the green box.

**ReSpeaker Core v2.0 - Voice Reception System**

This smart system consists of a voice assistant (ReSpeaker Core v2.0) and a phone assistant (Linklt One). As you can see, when a visitor tells the voice assistant the name of the person he is looking for, the little smart assistant will recognize and search the person in its database. If there is a matched name, our assistant will call him. And when the person confirms the visitor's ID, he just need to send the message "Open" to open the door so that the visitor can walk in.

How about having such a voice reception system in front of your house or work space? Isn’t it cool?

**ReSpeaker Core v2.0 - Simple Voice Reception System**

The basic function of the reception service is to greet visitors, make them feel welcome and prevent unauthorized access to the office. We leverage the ReSpeaker Core v2.0 functions to design a Voice Reception Service. The system can interact with visitor and drop message to the person to be visited. In future, we can design a small office employee phone list database, the employee can drop a message to the system, the system uses the GPIO functions of the ReSpeaker Core v2.0 to open the doors for the visitor. We use the Microsoft Bing Speech to text services and Twilio/Tencent message APIs to come out the python scripts.
