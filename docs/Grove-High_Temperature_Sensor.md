Thermocouples are very sensitive devices. It requires a good amplifier with cold-junction compensation. The Grove - High Temperatire Sensor uses a K-Type themocouple and a thermocouple amplifier that measures ambient temperature using thermistor for cold-junction compensation. The detectable range of this Sensor is -50~600°C , and the accuracy is ±(2.0% + 2°C).

!!!Caution
    The platforms mentioned above as supported is/are an indication of the module's hardware or theoritical compatibility. We only provide software library or code examples for Arduino platform in most cases. It is not possible to provide software library / demo code for all possible MCU platforms. Hence, users have to write their own software library.


## Getting Started

### Play with Arduino

#### Hardware

- Step 1. We need to prepare the below stuffs:

| Seeeduino V4.2 | Base Shield |  Grove-High Temperature Sensor|

- Step 2. Connect the Grove-High Temperature Sensor to **A0** on Base Shield.
- Step 3. Plug the base Shield into Seeeduino-V4.2.
- Step 4. Connect Seeeduino-V4.2 to PC by using a USB cable.

!!!Note
    If we don't have a Base Shield, don't worry, the sensor can be connected to your Arduino directly. Please follow below tables to connect with Arduino.

| Seeeduino |Grove-High Temperature Sensor |
|------------------|------- --|
| GND              | Black  |
| 5V               |  Red   |
| A1               | White  |
| A0               | Yellow |

#### Software

- Step 1. Download the  [Grove_HighTemp_Sensor Library](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_HighTemp_Sensor/archive/master.zip) from Github.
- Step 2. Refer [How to install library](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/How_to_install_Arduino_Library) to install library for Arduino.
- Step 3. Copy the code into Arduino IDE and upload.

```c++
#include "High_Temp.h"

HighTemp ht(A1, A0);

void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(115200);
    Serial.println("grove - hight temperature sensor test demo");
    ht.begin();
}

void loop()
{
    Serial.println(ht.getThmc());
    delay(100);
}
```

- Step 4. Open your Serial Monitor and set baud rate as 115200, We will see the temperature in Celsius here.

### Play With Raspberry Pi

#### Hardware

- Step 1. Prepare the below stuffs:

| Raspberry pi | GrovePi_Plus | Grove - Ultrasonic Ranger |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
|![enter image description here](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Grove_Ultrasonic_Ranger/raw/master/img/rasp.jpg)|![enter image description here](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Grove_Ultrasonic_Ranger/raw/master/img/Grovepi%2B.jpg)|![enter image description here](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-High_Temperature_Sensor/raw/master/img/High_Temperature_Sensor_s.jpg)|
|[Get ONE Now](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Raspberry-Pi-3-Model-B-p-2625.html)|[Get ONE Now](https://www.seeedstudio.com/GrovePi%2B-p-2241.html)|[Get ONE Now](https://seeedstudio.com/Grove-High-Temperature-Sensor-p-1810.html)|

- Step 2. Plug the GrovePi_Plus into Raspberry.
- Step 3. Connect Grove-Ultrasonic ranger to **A0** port of GrovePi_Plus.
- Step 4. Connect the Raspberry to PC through USB cable.

#### Software

- Step 1. Follow [Setting Software](https://www.dexterindustries.com/GrovePi/get-started-with-the-grovepi/setting-software/) to configure the development environment.
- Step 2. Follow [Updating the Firmware](https://www.dexterindustries.com/GrovePi/get-started-with-the-grovepi/updating-firmware/) to update the newest firmware of GrovePi.

!!!Tip
    In this wiki we use the path **~/GrovePi/** instead of **/home/pi/Desktop/GrovePi**, you need to make sure Step 2 and Step 3 use the same path.


!!!Note
    We firmly suggest you to update the firmware, or for some sensors you may get errors.

- Step 3. Git clone the Github repository.

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/DexterInd/GrovePi.git

```
- Step 4. Excute below commands to use the ultrasonic_ranger to meansure the distance.

```
cd ~/GrovePi/Software/Python/grove_hightemperature_sensor
python high_temperature_example.py
```

Here is the grove_ultrasonic.py code.

```python

import grove_hightemperature_sensor as grovepi # our library
from time import sleep # and for the sleep function
import sys # we need this for the exception throwing stuff

# Don't forget to run it with Python 3 !!
# Don't forget to run it with Python 3 !!
# Don't forget to run it with Python 3 !!

def Main():
    room_temperature_pin = 15 # this is equal to A1
    probe_temperature_pin = 14 # this is equal to A0
    # so you have to connect the sensor to A0 port

    # instatiate a HighTemperatureSensor object
    sensor = grovepi.HighTemperatureSensor(room_temperature_pin, probe_temperature_pin)

    # and do this indefinitely
    while True:
        # read the room temperature
        room_temperature = sensor.getRoomTemperature()
        # and also what's important to us: the temperature at the tip of the K-Type sensor
        probe_temperature = sensor.getProbeTemperature()

        # print it in a fashionable way
        print('[room temperature: {:5.2f}°C][probe temperature: {:5.2f}°C]'.format(room_temperature, probe_temperature))
        # and wait for 250 ms before taking another measurement - so we don't overflow the terminal
        sleep(0.25)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        Main()

    # in case CTRL-C / CTRL-D keys are pressed (or anything else that might interrupt)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print('[Keyboard interrupted]')
        sys.exit(0)

    # in case there's an IO error aka I2C
    except IOError:
        print('[IO Error]')
        sys.exit(0)

    # in case we have a math error (like division by 0 - can happen depending on the read values)
    # or if the values exceed a certain threshold
    # experiment and you'll see
    except ValueError as e:
        print('[{}]'.format(str(e)))
        sys.exit(0)
```

- Step 4. We will see the temperature display on terminal as below.

```
pi@raspberrypi:~/GrovePi/Software/Python/grove_hightemperature_sensor $ python high_temperature_example.py
[room temperature: 20.47°C][probe temperature: 32.19°C]
[room temperature: 20.47°C][probe temperature: 32.19°C]
[room temperature: 20.47°C][probe temperature: 32.19°C]
[room temperature: 20.47°C][probe temperature: 32.19°C]
[room temperature: 20.60°C][probe temperature: 32.19°C]
[room temperature: 20.60°C][probe temperature: 32.19°C]
[room temperature: 20.60°C][probe temperature: 32.19°C]
```
