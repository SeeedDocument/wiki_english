They will be used later.


#### Enable the Google Assistant API

Enable the Google Assistant API on the project you selected (see the [Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/terms-of-service)). You need to do this in the Cloud Platform Console.

Just click [Here](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/embeddedassistant.googleapis.com/overview) to enable the Google Assistant API.


Ensure the following toggle switches are enabled (blue):

- `Web & App Activity`

- `Device Information`
- `Voice & Audio Activity`



#### Install the SDK and Sample Code

You can refer ro [google doc](https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/guides/service/python/embed/install-sample) for more detail about this part.

You can do this part with python2.7 and python3, in this demo we use python2.7.

**For python2.7**

**Step 1.**

Tap the following command:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-virtualenv
sudo virtualenv env --no-site-packages  
env/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
source env/bin/activate

```


**Step 2. Get the package**

The Google Assistant SDK package contains all the code required to get the Google Assistant running on the device, including the sample code.

Install the package's system dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev
Use pip to install the latest version of the Python package in the virtual environment:
sudo python -m pip install --upgrade google-assistant-sdk[samples]

```



**Step 3. Generate credentials**

Install or update the authorization tool:

```
sudo python -m pip install --upgrade google-auth-oauthlib[tool]==0.2
```

Make the target folder.

```
sudo mkdir â€“p /path/to/assistant-sdk/
```

Use the command below to copy `credentials.json` to the target location.

```
sudo cp /home/respeaker/credentials.json /path/to/assistant-sdk/ 
```

Tap the command below to get the token generate code.

```
google-oauthlib-tool --scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/assistant-sdk-prototype \
          --save --headless --client-secrets /path/to/assistant-sdk/credentials.json

```

Note!!!
    By using the command above, Every time you get a different authorize code. Please make sure


Then you will get the code, please copy the code after the note `Please visit this URL to authorize this application:`.

Ok, then, you will get the authorize code as the following picture shown.


![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Google-Assitant/raw/master/img/code4.png)


Cope this code into your console
![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Google-Assitant/raw/master/img/code5.png)


Then you will see the notice `credentials saved: /path/to/.config/google-oauthlib-tool/credentials.json`. That means everything goes well so far.




#### Install Respeakerd

Tap the commands to install respeakerd

```
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev
git clone https://github.com/respeaker/googleassistant_respeakerd
cd googleassistant_respeakerd
sudo python setup.py install
sudo cp script/io.respeaker.respeaker.conf /etc/dbus-1/system.d/
# set respeakerd to pulse mode
sudo vim /etc/respeaker/respeakerd.conf 
# reboot to make it work
sudo reboot
```


#### Activate the Google Assistant.

Remember the two IDs we marked before? Now it's time to use them. 

Change the command `googlesamples-assistant-respeakerd --project-id my-dev-project --device-model-id my-model` with your own IDs.


For the command above, change `my-dev-project` into your `project-id` and change `my-model` into your `Model ID`.

For this demo, it should be like

```
googlesamples-assistant-respeakerd --project-id respeaker-440eb --device-model-id respeaker-xxxx-respeaker-core-v2.0-xxxxx
```

Now, cheers!!!
