Sidekick Advanced Kit include a set of basic component as well as lots of sensor and other modules.

We had a sketchbook for chapter of Sensor. you can download it [here](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/sketch_sidekick).

When you had downloaded the code, extract it to F: folder, or anywhere you prefer to.

Then open Arduino IDE, click File -&gt; Preferences:

Put Sketchbook location to the code you had downloaded, click OK to finish it. Reopen Arduino IDE.

Click File -&gt; Sketchbook, then you can fine some project now, that's the demo code of this chapter.
