The Hall sensor is based on Hall Effect, which is the production of a voltage difference across an electrical conductor, transverse to an electric current in the conductor and a magnetic field perpendicular to the current. There is a continuous-time switch on this Grove. The output of these devices switches low (turns on) when a magnetic field (south polarity) perpendicular to the Hall sensor exceeds the operate point threshold BOP, and it switches high (turn off) when the magnetic field disappears. The twig can be used to measure RPM.

!!!Caution
    The platforms mentioned above as supported is/are an indication of the module's software or theoritical compatibility. We only provide software library or code examples for Arduino platform in most cases. It is not possible to provide software library / demo code for all possible MCU platforms. Hence, users have to write their own software library.


## Application Ideas

-   RPM meter.
-   Simple dc motor.

## Getting Started

!!!Note
    If this is the first time you work with Arduino, we firmly recommend you to see [Getting Started with Arduino](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Getting_Started_with_Arduino/) before the start.


### Play With Arduino

#### Demonstration

The Hall Sensor is used by utilizing the external interrupts available on the arduino/seeeduino. In this example we are using interrupt 0, found on digital pin 2. For other interrupts, see the [attachInterrupt()](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/AttachInterrupt).

#### Hardware

- **Step 1.** Prepare the below stuffs:

| Seeeduino V4.2 | Base Shield| Grove - Hall Sensor |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
|![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove_Light_Sensor/master/images/gs_1.jpg)|![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove_Light_Sensor/master/images/gs_4.jpg)|![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-Hall_Sensor/master/img/Grove-Hall_Sensor_New%20_small.jpg)|

- **Step 2.** Connect Grove - Hall Sensor to port D2 of Grove-Base Shield.
- **Step 3.** Plug Grove - Base Shield into Seeeduino.
- **Step 4.** Connect Seeeduino to PC via a USB cable.

!!!Note
	If we don't have Grove Base Shield, We also can directly connect Grove - Hall Sensor to Seeeduino as below.

| Seeeduino       | Grove - Hall Sensor |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| 5V           | Red                     |
| GND           | Black                   |
| Not Conencted | White                   |
| D2            | Yellow                  |


#### Software

- **Step 1.**  Download the [Hall Sensor Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-Hall_Sensor/master/res/Grove-Hall_Sensor_Demo_Code.zip)

- **Step 2.**  Open one of two code. For example Demo **MagnetControlLED**


- **Step 3.**  Copy the code into Arduino IDE and upload. If you do not know how to upload the code, please check [how to upload code](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Upload_Code/).

void setup()
{
 	pinsInit();
}
 
void loop() 
{
	if(isNearMagnet())//if the hall sensor is near the magnet?
	{
		turnOnLED();
	}
	else
	{
		turnOffLED();
	}
}
void pinsInit()
{
	pinMode(HALL_SENSOR, INPUT);
	pinMode(LED,OUTPUT);
}

/*If the hall sensor is near the magnet whose south pole is facing up, */
/*it will return ture, otherwise it will return false.				*/
boolean isNearMagnet()
{
	int sensorValue = digitalRead(HALL_SENSOR);
	if(sensorValue == LOW)//if the sensor value is LOW?
	{
		return true;//yes,return ture
	}
	else
	{
		return false;//no,return false
	}
}
void turnOnLED()
{
	digitalWrite(LED,HIGH);
}
void turnOffLED()
{
	digitalWrite(LED,LOW);
}
```

- **Step 4.**  When a magnet whose south pole is facing up is approaching to the onboard sensor, the LED will be turned on. Otherwise, the LED will be turned off.

### Play with Codecraft

#### Hardware

**Step 1.** Connect a Grove - Hall Sensor to port D2, and connect a Grove - Red LED to port D4 of a Base Shield.

**Step 2.** Plug the Base Shield to your Seeeduino/Arduino.

**Step 3.** Link Seeeduino/Arduino to your PC via an USB cable.

#### Software

**Step 1.** Open [Codecraft](https://ide.chmakered.com/), add Arduino support, and drag a main procedure to working area.

!!!Note
    If this is your first time using Codecraft, see also [Guide for Codecraft using Arduino](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Guide_for_Codecraft_using_Arduino/).

**Step 2.** Drag blocks as picture below or open the cdc file which can be downloaded at the end of this page.

![cc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-Hall_Sensor/master/img/cc_Hall_Sensor.png)

Upload the program to your Arduino/Seeeduino.

!!!Success
    When the code finishes uploaded, the LED will goes on when Hall Sensor detects changes in the magnetic field.
