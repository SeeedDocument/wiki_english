Grove - Digital Distance Interrupter 0.5 to 5cm is an infrared distance sensing module based on GP2Y0D805Z0F. Normaly the output of this sensor is 1(High), when the object enters the measurement range of the sensor, it will be triggered and output a 0(LOW).At the same time the on-board LED will light up. As the name suggests, the measurement range is from 0.5cm to 5cm.


There are two types of  Grove - Digital Distance Interrupter 0.5 to 5cm: Grove - Digital Distance Interrupter 0.5 to 5cm(GP2Y0D805Z0F)  and [Grove - Digital Distance Interrupter 0.5 to 5cm(GP2Y0D805Z0F)(P)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Digital-Distance-Interrupter-0.5-to-5cm%28GP2Y0D805Z0F%29%28P%29-p-3085.html). For the version without letter P, the lens and the grove interface are at the same side; for the version with letter P, the lens and the grove interface are at the different sides.

GP2Y0D805Z0F is a distance measuring sensor unit, composed of an integrated combination of PD(photo diode) , IRED (infrared emitting diode) and signal processing circuit. The variety of the reflectivity of the object, the environmental temperature and the operating duration are not influenced easily to the distance detection because of adopting the triangulation method.

!!!Caution
    The platforms mentioned above as supported is/are an indication of the module's software or theoritical compatibility. We only provide software library or code examples for Arduino platform in most cases. It is not possible to provide software library / demo code for all possible MCU platforms. Hence, users have to write their own software library.



## Getting Started

!!!Note
    If this is the first time you work with Arduino, we strongly recommend you to see [Getting Started with Arduino](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Getting_Started_with_Arduino/) before the start.

!!!note
    **1** Please plug the USB cable gently, otherwise you may damage the port. Please use the USB cable with 4 wires inside, the 2 wires cable can't transfer data. If you are not sure about the wire you have, you can click [here](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Micro-USB-Cable-48cm-p-1475.html) to buy
    
    **2** Each Grove module comes with a Grove cable when you buy. In case you lose the Grove cable, you can click [here](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Universal-4-Pin-Buckled-20cm-Cable-%285-PCs-pack%29-p-936.html) to buy.

|---------------|-------------------------|
| 5V            | Red                     |
| GND           | Black                   |
| Not Conencted | White                   |
| D2            | Yellow                  |



#### Software

- **Step 1.** Open the Arduino IDE and create a new file, then copy the following code into the new file.

#define SENSOR  2

void setup()
{
	Serial.begin(115200);
	pinMode(SENSOR,INPUT);
}


void loop()
{
	short val=0;
	val=digitalRead(SENSOR);
	Serial.print("val=");
	Serial.println((int)val);
	if(0==val)
	{
		Serial.println("Sensor is triggered!!");
	}
	delay(100);
}

```

- **Step 2.** Upload the demo. If you do not know how to upload the code, please check [How to upload code](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Upload_Code/).

- **Step 3.** Open the **Serial Monitor** of Arduino IDE by click **Tool-> Serial Monitor**. Or tap the ++ctrl+shift+m++ key at the same time. Change the baud rate to **115200**.
if every thing goes well, you will get the output of this module.

The result should be something like that:

```
val=1
val=1
val=1
val=1
val=1
val=1
val=0
Sensor is triggered!!
val=0
Sensor is triggered!!
val=0
Sensor is triggered!!
val=1
val=1
val=1
val=1
```

Normaly the output of this sensor is 1(High), when the object enters the measurement range of the sensor, it will be triggered and output a 0(LOW)
