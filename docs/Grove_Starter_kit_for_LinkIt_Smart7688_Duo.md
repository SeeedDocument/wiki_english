A simple demo
-------------

You can build an IoT application easily with Grove modules supplied in this kit. Now we use some Grove modules supplied to build a demonstrative IoT application, which is used to collect data from sensors in house and control home appliances. To be specific, this demonstrative application achieve following functions:

-   Collect data on illumination strength, ambient temperature and humidity and display them on OLED screen, these data also can be accessed from a cloud server.
-   Use a relay to connect a desk lamp, with which you can switch the lamp with a control or switch the lamp with a button from the cloud server.
