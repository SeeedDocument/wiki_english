##   About PCB service
---
As hobbyists ourselves, we organize local mfg power, panelize designs, reduce the shipping cost, and ensure the quality. It will be a source to sustain our studio along with other services we provide.

###   Fusion PCB Order Steps

1.  Go to Fusion PCB order page https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html

2.  Upload Gerber File and select parameters.

3.  Checkout and pay the order.

If the file and design meets requirements, they will be processed and shipped in 4-6 days (Excluding the Chinese Festival).

###   Gerber file requirement

**The following layers are needed:**

*   Top layer:    pcbname.GTL
*   Bottom layer:    pcbname.GBL
*   Solder Stop Mask top:  pcbname.GTS
*   Solder Stop Mask Bottom pcbname.GBS
*   Silk Top:   pcbname.GTO
*   Silk Bottom pcbname.GBO
*   NC Drill:        pcbname.TXT
*   Board outline must be included at least in one layer.

*   The Gerber file must be RS-274x format.

###   PCB design tips

SINGLE DESIGN, NO PANELIZING

**Note:**

*   Your Gerber file must include only one design.
*   Drills line and long slot can’t be accepted
*   Minimum slot 1mm*1mm
*   DRC compatible as rule file attached
*   The PCB size is smallest rectangle that can accommodate PCB

**Available Quantity option:** 10pcs, 50pcs, 100pcs and more.

THE MINIMAL QUANTITY WE CAN START HERE IS 5pcs.

**Note:** If you want to order more than 10pcs, please do check the price for different options and choose the most economic one.

**Example:**
For PCB size (50mm X 100mm), 4 × 10pcs option cost more than 1 × 50pcs option.
