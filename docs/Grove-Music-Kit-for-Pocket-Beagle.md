PocketBeagle is an ultra-tiny-yet-complete open-source USB-key-fob computer. PocketBeagle features an incredibly low cost, slick design, and simple usage, making PocketBeagle the ideal development board for beginners and professionals alike. Its rich features allow users to programmatically control external devices and obtain data from external devices.

Grove is a modular, standardized connector prototyping system. Consisting of Sensor, Actuator, Display, Communication, and Other function modules. Grove takes a building block approach to assemble electronics. Compared to the jumper or solder based system, it is easier to connect, experiment and build and simplifies the learning system. 

The Grove Music Kit for Pocket Beagle combines the Grove sensor modules with the powerful programming capabilities of Pocket Beagle, allowing students to interact with music using real-world information such as light, touch, keyboard, Slide Potentiometer, posture and so on, to create cool projects.
