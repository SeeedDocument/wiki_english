The LinkIt Connect 7681 development board provides easy access to the five GPIO pins and one UART port — each with an LED — of the MT7681, to quickly connect peripheral controllers and electronic circuits. The MT7681 is provided on the LinkIt Connect 7681 module, which was co-designed with AcSiP. This module, which is only 15 x 18mm, will also be available separately for direct integration into your product’s PCB.
