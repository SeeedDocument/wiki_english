Grove - High Precision RTC based on the clock chip PCF85063TP which is a CMOS Real-Time Clock (RTC) and calendar optimized for low power consumption. An offset register allows fine-tuning of the clock. All addresses and data are transferred serially via the I2C bus and the maximum bus speed is 400 kbit/s.

Compared to [Grove - RTC](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-RTC-p-758.html), this module can provide a more accurate result. And provide a programmable clock output for peripheral devices as well as minute and half minute interrupt.

##Getting Started

After this section, you can make **Grove - High Precision RTC** run with only few steps.

###Preparations

Now we are making a demo for Grove - High Precision RTC module, in this demo we'll use a terminal to view the data. Here are what we need to use for this demo.
 
* [Seeeduino Lotus](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-Lotus-ATMega328-Board-with-Grove-Interface-p-1942.html)*1
* [Grove - High Precision RTC](https://www.seeedstudio.com/)*1


If this is your first time using [Seeeduino Lotus](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-Lotus-ATMega328-Board-with-Grove-Interface-p-1942.html), please refer to [Seeeduino Lotus's wiki](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino_Lotus/).

Seeeduino Lotus is fully compatible with Arduino which works as simple as Arduino.

If this is your first time using Arduino, Please put hand on [here](http://arduino.cc) to start your Arduino journey.

###Connecting hardware

[Seeeduino Lotus](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-Lotus-ATMega328-Board-with-Grove-Interface-p-1942.html) is a combination of Seeeduino and Base Shield. We can connect the RTC module to the I2C socket directly as the below picture shows.
