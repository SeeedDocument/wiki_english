#**BeagleBone Solutions**
##**An Open-source Embedded Platform Powerful Enough for Developers, but Friendly Enough for Students**
![Customization](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/BeagleBoneSolutions/blob/master/img/BBG_Customization.png?raw=true)

The BeagleBone is a versatile platform capable of running a full Linux OS while also retaining real-time capability. Designed with industrial use in mind, and documentation designed for entry-level developers, the BeagleBone has numerous I/O and protocol support while being developer friendly.

Seeed's [BeagleBone Green](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/BeagleBone_Green/) and [BeagleBone Green Wireless](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/BeagleBone_Green_Wireless/) are part of the BeagleBone family and are ready to be customized, manufactured, and deployed **now**.

You can view our customization portfolio [here](#portfolio).

##**SDKs, HDKs, and Community**

The BeagleBone is fully open source software and hardware. This allows developers to fully understand the development platform and quickly identify what can and cannot be supported. In addition there is an active community which can provide help provide answers that may not be clear or easy to find otherwise

##**Built for Prototyping**
![prototyping](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/BeagleBoneSolutions/blob/master/img/Prototyping.gif?raw=true)

The BeagleBone is a SBC development board designed for quick prototyping.  There are numerous capes which add additional functionality, allowing proof of concepts to be quickly built. Many of these capes are designed by the community and are fully open source as well. In addition we have created a Grove cape to allow many of our [Grove Modules](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_System/) to be attached, allowing developers access to 200+ open source modules and their open source libraries.

##**Customization**

Designed as a development board, the BeagleBone does not feature industrial connectors, or many other features that are suitable for deployment. Our customization service is the solution. We can add components, change connectors, and more.

###ODM Cost
Our ODM costs are starting prices. More features or having to bring in specialist engineers for a project can cause the NRE and hourly rates to increase change. This does not include manufacturing costs. To discuss how we calculate costs, or any other questions please email us at [iot@seeed.cc](iot@seeed.cc).

|                           | NRE Fee | Hourly | Min Order Quantity | CE & FCC Certification |
|---------------------------|---------|--------|--------------------|------------------------|
| BeagleBone Green          | $10,000 |   $40+ |                500 |                $3,000+ |
| BeagleBone Green Wireless | $10,000 |   $40+ |                500 |                $3,000+ |




###Timeline
![ODM timeline](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/BeagleBoneSolutions/blob/master/img/Timeline.png?raw=true)

We know your projects are often time critical. To help you understand the process and time we have provided this simplified timeline. Each project is a unique case. Adding extensive functionality, or requiring numerous different certifications could greatly extend the project timeline. You can download a more detailed timeline [here](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/BeagleBoneSolutions/blob/master/res/ODM_Detailed_Timeline.pdf).
