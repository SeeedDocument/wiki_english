TFT Touch Shield V2.0 is a resistive touch screen, compatible with Arduino/Seeeduino/Arduino Mega/SAMD21 platforms. It can be used as display device or sketch pad. Compared with the previous version, 2.8''TFT Touch Shield V1.0, we upgraded the screen driver to a more professional chip, ILI9341 driver, providing different pin-saving SPI communication without sacrificing the data transmitting speed. Due to the communication method change, programs developed for the original version are needed for modification before being transplanted to the new version. With a SD card module integrated on this shield, this shield reserves capability for other expansions of your project.

### Download Arduino Library

This library supports below platforms:

* Arduino/Genuino UNO
* Seeeduino V3/4.0/4.2
* Arduino/Genuino Mega
* Arduino Leonardo
* Seeeduino Lite/Clio/Lotus
* LinkIt ONE(Touch panel does not work)

Click to download the [Touch Screen Driver](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Touch_Screen_Driver/archive/master.zip)ï¼Œthen please click on below button to download the library and install it, if you don't know how to install an Arduino library, please refer to the tutorial [(HOW TO INSTALL AN ARDUINO LIBRARY)](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/How_to_install_Arduino_Library/).

[![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/TFT_Touch_Shield_V2/master/images/library.png)](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/TFT_Touch_Shield_V2/archive/master.zip)

This library includes below examples,

* drawCircle
* drawLines
* drawNumber
* drawRectangle
* paint
* shapes
* text
* tftbmp
* tftbmp2

We use example 'shapes' for this demo.

!!!Note
    We recommend using Seeed_Arduino_LCD with internal flash chips larger than 128k. If you have a smaller flash device, I recommend using the TFT_Touch_Shield_V2.


### Connect the cables and Upload the code

**Step1.** Insert the TFT_Touch_Shield_V2 board to Seeeduino,

**Step2.** Connect your Seeeduino board to computer with USB cable

**Step3.** Open Arduino IDE, Select the correct COM port and Boards(in this example we use Seeeduino V4)

**Step4.** Click on **File > Examples > TFT_Touch_Shield_V2-master > shapes** to open the code. Upload the example to Seeeduino.

## Backlight

The backlight is always default on, if you want to change the backlight, you need to do some hacking on the board. Please look at the back side of the board. There's a BACKLIGHT label. One side is named as ON, and the other side is named D7. We need to cut the wire between middle pad and ON pad, solder middle pad with D7 pad. As shown below.

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/TFT_Touch_Shield_V2/master/images/backlight.png)

Then you can control the backlight via D7.

 To open backlight:
     digitalWrite(7, HIGH);

To close backlight:
    digitaWrite(7, LOW);

!!!Warning
    Please be careful when use a box cutter and soldering iron.
