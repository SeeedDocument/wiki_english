##**Choosing Your ReSpeaker**

So you know a little bit about the purpose and use of the ReSpeaker Line - either from our [solutions page](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_Solutions/) or our [introduction page](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker/), but what product(s) actually fit your needs? Don't worry - this self aware page is here to help.

##**The Three Categories**

Currently the ReSpeaker line has 3 primary board categories. While all three of these categories are designed to help enable voice interface they are each designed to integrate into projects differently.

- SBC Solution
- Mic Array Solution
- and Raspberry Pi Mic Array Solutions

###**SBC Solution**
![SBC Solution](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/ReSpeakerProductGuide/blob/master/img/SBC_Solution.png?raw=true)

For projects that revolve fully around voice interaction the ReSpeaker Core line is ideal. Functioning as SBCs they are able to not only able to listen for voice, perform software based DSP for front-end audio processing, but also to control the overall process of the project. From manipulating hardware to running advanced user application code the ReSpeaker Core line is designed to be the center of their projects.

Suggested for: Developers, Businesses

**The [ReSpeaker Core v2.0](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_Core_v2.0/)** features significant processing power as well as an integrated 6 microphone circular array. In the middle of the board is the core module, which contains the SoC, memory (RAM), and PMU. on the outside edges of the board are the peripherals, including connectors, WiFi modules, LEDs, and the microphone array. This allows for easy customization and makes the ReSpeaker Core v2.0 an excellent all-in-one board solution for projects, reducing the cost when moving projects to scale.


###**Mic Array Solution**
![MicArraySolution](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/ReSpeakerProductGuide/blob/master/img/Mic_Array_Solution.png?raw=true)

The ReSpeaker Mic Array Line uses hardware DSP for front end acceleration, returning clean voice to the system it is integrated into. This makes it ideal to add into existing projects that would benefit from voice interface.

Suggested for: Developers, Maker Pros, Businesses

**[The ReSpeaker Mic Array v2.0](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_Mic_Array_v2.0/)** is a circular microphone array powered by the XMOS XVF3000. It features hardware enabled front-end audio processing and is compatible with most common OSs including Windows, macOS, and many Linux distributions. It is capable of audio output as well, which when used allows for AEC. The microphone configuration is able to be configured and customized as well.

###**Raspberry Pi Mic Array Solutions**

We have created several ReSpeaker Shields for the Raspberry Pi. For users who want to experiment with simple voice commands, create their own Amazon Echo or Google Home, or develop on the Raspberry Pi the mic arrays for the Raspberry Pi are an excellent choice. Similar to other ReSpeaker products these can also be customized.

The **[ReSpeaker 4-Mic Linear Array Kit](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_4-Mic_Linear_Array_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi/)** is great for projects which are stationary against a wall. Capable of 180° voice detection, this kit can detect relative location, or focus on a specific direction while ignoring other voice inputs. The array has a flexible cable allowing it to be placed in numerous orientations and allowing more options for enclosure design. Unlike other boards, this contains only a single blue LED.

Notable Features:

- 4-Mic Linear Array
- Ribbon Cable for Flexible Placement
- 1 x Blue LED
- 2 x Grove Connectors (I2C & Digital)
- 1 x 3.5mm Audio Jack (Stereo)
- 1 x JST Speaker Connectors (Mono)


The **[ReSpeaker 6-Mic Circular Array Kit](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_6-Mic_Circular_Array_kit_for_Raspberry_Pi/)** is great for projects which may be placed in the center of people. Capable of 360° voice detection, this kit can detect relative location, or focus on a specific direction while ignoring other voice inputs. The array has a flexible cable allowing it to be placed in numerous orientations and allowing more options for enclosure design.

Notable Features:

- 6-Mic Circular Array
- Ribbon Cable for Flexible Placement
- 12 x RGB LEDs
- 2 x Grove Connectors (I2C & Digital)
- 1 x 3.5mm Audio Jack (Stereo)
- 1 x JST Speaker Connectors (Mono)


The **[ReSpeaker 4-Mic Array](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_4_Mic_Array_for_Raspberry_Pi/)** (circular) is capable of 360° voice detection. However, unlike the other boards it does not have audio output capability, requiring the Raspberry Pi to support all output audio alone. The board features 4 microphones, 12 RGB LEDs, and 2 grove connectors.

Notable Features:

- 4-Mic Circular Array
- 12 RGB LEDs
- 2 x Grove connectors (I2C & GPIO)

!!!Note
    There is no audio output interface on ReSpeaker 4-Mic Array for Raspberry Pi. It is only for voice capture. You can use the [headphone jack](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/audio-config.md) on Raspberry Pi for audio output. If your project requires higher quality audio output please select a different product.


The **[ReSpeaker 2-Mic Pi HAT](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_2_Mics_Pi_HAT/)** is a great entry level choice. It is important to note that unlike the other items in this category the 2-Mic HAT cannot detect the direction of the speaker, it is designed only for far-field voice input.

Notable Features:

- Dual Microphones
- Ribbon Cable for Flexible Placement
- 3 x RGB LEDs
- 2 x Grove Connectors (I2C & Digital)
- 1 x 3.5mm Audio Jack (Stereo)
- 1 x JST Speaker Connectors (Mono)
