The acrylic case is used for raspberry pi B+, It’s made of acrylic sheet. manufacture by laser cutting, CNC milling, and hot bending. almost all handmade, Looks very compact and beautiful, Only 4 pieces sheets in total, so easy to assembled. It's strong enought, not easy break like other 6 acrylic sheets case. In the box rounded corners and beveled edges  .you will feel very comfortable when you hold it.

##  Feature

*   Simple structure
*   Easy to assemble
*   Compact appearance

##  How to made the case about seeedstudio

It's different from the others case just like 6-acrylic sheets laser cutting case and injection model. Although it's cheap and fast made, But maybe some people think it no personality. Now,there is a case for Raspberry PI B+ is out of the common, it's designed by seeedstudio engineer. It's not made by large scale way just like injection model and simple laser cutting. Made the case requires 3 kinds of production process——laser cutting ,CNC milling and hot bending. all the processes are suitable for small scale project.

<big>**The first process——Laser Cutting**</big>

We should cutting it by laser cutting machine, It's cheap and fast.

<big>**The second process——CNC milling**</big>

After laser cutting you we should cutting some structure let it easy assembly and bending.

<big>**The third process——hot bending**</big>

The last process is hot bending, We can use the heater heating the acrylic notch which is machined by CNC milling machine.

After you know the 3 processes maybe you can understand why we said it's out of the common.
