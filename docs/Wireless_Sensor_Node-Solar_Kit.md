**Wireless Sensor Node - Solar Kit** is an easy to use bundle created for experimenting with XBee and **XBee** compatible standalone wireless modules like RFBee and [Wifi Bee](/Wifi_Bee "Wifi Bee"). Every **maker** is confronted with the question of selection the right set of components to build **Wireless Sensor Node**. **Wireless Sensor Node - Solar Kit** fills this place very appropriately. The [Grove - XBee Carrier](/Grove-XBee_Carrier "Grove - XBee Carrier") provides LDO power supply, charger for LiPo Battery and programming port for **XBee** compatible modules. The **Solar Panel** provides the required charging voltage in remote areas. The **500 mAH LiPo Battery** provides the backup when the Sun is away. A properly designed and configured wireless module could provide very long hours of usage. For this, put the node to sleep when not transmitting the sensor value. This kit comes with a perfectly made **Transparent Box** , sets of **Screws** and **Plastic Rivets**.

*   We suggest you to buy more than one kit to create a distributed array of Sensor Nodes.

*   [Bees Shield](/Bees_Shield "Bees Shield") along with **Seeeduino** and **Wifi Bee** can act as Wireless internet Gateway for these nodes.

###   Quick Start Guide

This section provides a Step-by-Step construction of a Wireless Sensor Node. Images are only for illustrating the procedure of that step. We have used two different setups of Grove - Xbee Carrier and Grove modules. So, just follow the procedure.

| Step | Procedure                                                                                                        | Illustration                                                                                                                                 |
