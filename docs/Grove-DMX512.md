The Grove â€“ DMX512 is a adapter from Grove interface to DMX512 interface(industry standard EIA-485 interface. The module is based on SN75176 chip which can balance transmission lines and meet ANSI Standard EIA-485 interface. Now it is convenience to control stage lighting and DMX512 console for Arduino.

##  Feature
---
*   Grove Interface and standard EIA-485 interface

*   Easy to use

*   Strong practicability

##  Usage
---
Arduino can easily control DMX512 device by using the Grove - DXM512 module. Take the LED crystal magic ball light as an example. The Specific Operation as follows:

*   Connect Grove interface of Grove - DMX512 to D3 port of [Grove - Base Shield](/Base_Shield_V2 "Grove - Base Shield") and plug Grove - Base Shield to Arduino.

*   Connect DMX512 interface of Grove - DMX512 to the DMXIN interface of the LED crystal magic ball light using a DMX cable. And power for the LED crystal magic ball light.

*   Set the LED crystal magic ball light to DMX512 control mode. The control panel display "A001" at the moment.

*   Download [File: DmxSimple Library](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-DMX512/raw/master/res/DmxSimple.zip) and  Unzip it into the libraries file of Arduino IDE by the path: ..\arduino-1.0.1\libraries.

*   Open the code directly by the path:File -&gt; Example -&gt;DmxSimple-&gt;Fadup1.

*   You can see a interesting scene. Try to change code for your enjoy.
