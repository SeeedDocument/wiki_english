Here is the wiki page for Both Seeeduino V2.2 Atmega 168P and Seeeduino V2.2 Atmega 328P.

And Now Seeeduino V2.2 Atmega 168P is out of stock.

Seeeduino is Arduino compatible board. Its design is based on Diecimila scheme, 100% compatible to its existing program, shield and IDEs. On the hardware part, remarkable changes are taken to improve the flexibility and user experience.

Seeeduino V2.2 Atmega 328 Model:[ARD128D2P](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/seeeduino-v22-atmega-328p-p-669.html?cPath=80)


##   Features  ##

-  Inherits all of Arduino Diecimila's features, except DIL-package microcontroller in socket replaced by SMD

-  Compatible to Diecimila's pin layout, screw hole and dimensions.

-  Evolved with SMD components

-  Improved on extensibility and convenience

##   Application Ideas   ##

- Data logging

- Remote sensor node

- Robotic control

##   Cautions   ##

The warnings and wrong operations possible cause dangerous.

##   Schematic   ##

It is the schematic, the circuit about Eagle resource like .pdf should linked here in order to avoid memory exhausted.

##   Specification   ##

May include key specification and other specifications.

##   Usage   ##

If you are using the Arduino Development Environment to program the board, select the Anduino Duemilanove board from the boards list.

If the serial port does not show up when you connect the Seeeduino to the computer, you have to download the appropriate USB to serial drivers.
The Windows, Linux, and Mac drivers can be downloaded here: [http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm)

##   Bug Tracker   ##

Bug Tracker is the place you can publish any bugs you think you might have found during use. Please write down what you have to say, your answers will help us improve our products.

-  The mini-USB connector can break off the board very easily if you apply sidewise force while a mini-USB cable is connected. Consider using an extension USB cable and refrain for plugging/unplugging the mini-USB cable to/from the Seeduino board very often.

##   Additional Idea   ##

The Additional Idea is the place to write your project ideas about this product, or other usages you've found. Or you can write them on Projects page.
