Seeeduino Ethernet is a compact and multifunctional development platform, which merges data logging and processing, device control and Ethernet communication together into one. It's armed with a MEGA328P chip and a Wiz5100: the former provides an Arduino controlling style and the latter provides TCP and UDP Ethernet communication ability. Plus integrated SD card module, it's convenient and neat for remote data logging, processing or transferring via network.

In this version, we lowered the height of RJ45 to balance it with the headers. Besides, with an I2C and a UART Grove port populated,it's convenient to connect corresponding Grove modules to this board.

##   Demonstration
---
We will test the Seeeduino Ethernet functions of writing or reading information from the SD Card and sending out A/D data to network.

###   Step 1: Install the Hardware

Firstly, install the hardware. We have two alternatives to plug in the power.

**Method 1**: You can use one [Passive PoE Cable Set](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/passive-poe-cable-set-p-1175.html?cPath=207) to provide power and Ethernet connection at the same time like the picture below.

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Seeeduino_Ethernet/raw/master/img/Seeeduino_ethernet-3.jpg)

**Method 2**:  Use separate power cable and Ethernet cable.

###   Step 2: Programing

After hardware installation, here we continue to try the test code.
This program is written to test the functions of writing or reading data from the SD Card and sending out A/D data to network.
This demo code can be used as a test program as well as reference if you wanna explore more functions of the board.

<font color="red">NOTICE: </font>

1. All the ".h" file needed have been pre-installed in Arduino IDE(1.0).

2. Install a Micro SD card. Make sure the Micro SD card is not full and the format is FAT or FAT32.

/*
  SD card read/write

 This example shows how to read and write data to and from an SD card file
 The circuit:
 * SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
 ** MOSI - pin 11
 ** MISO - pin 12
 ** CLK - pin 13
 ** CS - pin 4

   Web Server

 A simple web server that shows the value of the analog input pins.
 using an Arduino Wiznet Ethernet shield.

 Circuit:
 * Ethernet shield attached to pins 10, 11, 12, 13
 * Analog inputs attached to pins A0 through A5 (optional)

###   Step 3: Download the program

Because there is no USB connector on the board. Seeeduino Ethernet requires a [UartSBee](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/uartsbee-v4-p-688.html?cPath=109) to download the program. 

Connect the UartSBee to Seeeduino Ethernet as below:

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Seeeduino_Ethernet/raw/master/img/Seeeduinoethernet-11.jpg)

 ![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Seeeduino_Ethernet/raw/master/img/Seeeduino_ethernet-5.jpg)

!!!Warning
    Please select Seeeduino V3.0 as board in tool menu to download the program.


###   Step 4: Result testing

<font color="red">NOTICE:</font> Make sure the Seeeduino Ethernet and your computer are in the same local area network.
After the program was downloaded, open the Serial Monitor. You will check the status of the board.

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Seeeduino_Ethernet/raw/master/img/Seeeduinoethernet-9.jpg)

Open a web browser and enter the web address:192.168.1.177, then you can check the data sent out by Seeeduino Ethernet:
