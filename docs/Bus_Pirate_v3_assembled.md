The BusPirate v3 is a universal bus interface that talks to electronics from a PC serial terminal, eliminating a ton of early prototyping effort when working with new or unknown chips.

**Protocols:** 1-Wire, I2C, SPI, JTAG, asynchronous serial (UART), MIDI, PC keyboard, HD44780 LCDs, and generic 2- and 3-wire libraries for custom protocols.
