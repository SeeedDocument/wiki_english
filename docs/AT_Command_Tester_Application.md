[AT Command Tester](http://m2msupport.net/m2msupport/module-tester/) is an online tool for testing AT commands and other module functionalities such as [data call](http://m2msupport.net/m2msupport/data-call-at-commands-to-set-up-gprsedgeumtslte-data-call/), [voice call](http://m2msupport.net/m2msupport/voice-call-at-commands-to-set-up-voice-call/),[HTTP](http://m2msupport.net/m2msupport/at-command-for-http-functions-for-remote-server-data-access/), [network registration](http://m2msupport.net/m2msupport/network-registration/), [SMS](http://m2msupport.net/m2msupport/sms-at-commands/), [Phonebook](http://m2msupport.net/m2msupport/sim-phonebook-at-commands/), [signal quality](http://m2msupport.net/m2msupport/signal-quality/), [SIM interface](http://m2msupport.net/m2msupport/sim-at-commands-for-sim-presense-and-status/), [device info](http://m2msupport.net/m2msupport/at-commands-to-get-device-information/) etc.

AT Command Tester can be used with [2G Modules](http://m2msupport.net/m2msupport/category/devices/gprs-modem/) (GPRS/EDGE/1x) or [3G Modules](http://m2msupport.net/m2msupport/category/devices/3g-modules/) (HSDPA/HSPA/EVDO) or [4G modules](http://m2msupport.net/m2msupport/search-page/?Max!Download!Speed=100%20Mbps) (LTE)

First select 'Find Ports' to search for avaialble ports. Then select the modem port and press 'Connect'. Once connected to the module, you can send AT commands from the 'Command Mode' tab

 In script mode, you can send multiple AT commands at a same time as shown below. You can create your own script and save it on the local machine.Then load the script and execute.
