The Xadow Audio integrates a speaker box and a microphone on one single board. The speaker unit is rated at 0.7Watt with an impedance of 8 ohm. Unlike the regular cone type speakers, the loudspeaker driver used on the Xadow Audio has a flat surface and is mounted in a rectangular enclosure, which enables it to reproduce sounds at an amazing effect.
