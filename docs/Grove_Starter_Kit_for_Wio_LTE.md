The Grove Starter Kit for Wio LTE is a simple and cost effective choice for you to get a quick start with the Wio LTE board. Grove is open source ready-to-use tool set optimized for simplisity and rapid protptyping. We have integrated 6 Grove intefaces on the [Wio LTE board](https://www.seeedstudio.com/s/wio%20lte.html), which means that you don't need an expansion board this time, just plug the module and play with it. There are more than 150+ different Groves currently, if you are not familiar with Grove, this kit is definitly a perfect choice.



The kit includes seven well selected Grove modules by us. There are light sensor and temp&humi sensor that can monitor ambient light, temperature and humidity, digital accelerometer sensor that can detect motion data, actuators like relay, and digital input&output like button and buzzer. They are simple, but with all rounded functions for learning and rapid prototypying.

## Getting Started

###  Fundamentals with Arduino

You need to know some essential knowledge if it is the first time that you get involved with Arduino. We have prepared some documentations for you to start with
Arduino quickly and effectively. You can visit [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Foundations](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Foundations).

###  Arduino Sketches (basic example for each module)

After you have gotten an LED blinking (for Windows user, you can find it at [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows), you can find other versions for Mac OS and Linux variants at
[https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage) ), you still need to get familiar with Seeedstudio Grove system at [http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_System](/Grove_System). And now, you can do some more practical quizzes which are specialized designed for this kit. Download the sketches of quizzes at [https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Sketchbook_Starter_Kit_for_Arduino](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Sketchbook_Starter_Kit_for_Arduino).
